How i tried to find juniors(interns) with unpaid option for my project.

1) Assumption = checkout with big onlin e-learning websites(10 tries)
only treehouse replied and accept that i can post my description at their online forum.
2) other job sources like linkedin, indeed, others
3) prepare more information ad start later, when i'll be ready
4 check PH for such kind of projects, i/e/ job boards
5 research AngelList
of coursei was start not from scratch. LI and AL have a big network of my friends, so it was easy

Also my prev experience like recruiter helps me. So maybe you'll need this skills too.
AngelList have new tool(Talent) and i don't use it before. [pic] this is how talent looks


I create a new company profile at AL(empty without any data)
check radio button - want to hire people and then i get access to it.
i didn't plan to post my job but Talent was so cooltool, so i decided to give a try.
I post a job offer with only a title.
No fancy and positive words.

Talent give you an ability to filter people by different resume related keywords, flags, etc.

Spend sometime on it, play with it and check the results

Read each profile caryfully, because sometimes Talen is still buggy. I mark "Remote OK" flag, but in 30% results i get people with text(not open for remote work)
if you like this job-seeker - you need to ask intro by clicking Yes. (Each talent will be added to your "yes list" and you'll be able to review them later)
If talent agree to start a chat with you - he will show their interest by approving your request.

Al trying to avoid spam with this systems. also you cannot send more than 3 messages without any reply from other side. This restriction works with friends too at AL.
