### What would be your advice to a designer who wants to start a freelance business

Before I finished this article I decide to ask the similar question at Quora and check what other professionals can advise.

The internet is full of places, where you can find a client. Just Do it!

Are you ready?
So here a funny cat for you:



## Self-presentation is a key
I think that designer have more options to sell myself and my services.
If you are software developer what will you show? your code? it's not easy to judge by your code.

## Portfolio
It's important to have an organized and beautiful portfolio.
Don't make a screenshot and that it. You need to explain what was done.
How it was done. Follow this rule: try to fill a one piece of paper with details about your completed project.


So, each project must have detailed explanation?
Yep. I mean really detailed. At least 5-10 sentences.
Try to answer questions like this:
* How much time you spend on it?
* How it looks before?
* What complex, but interesting things did you do?

### Places
My preferences of websites where to look for clients:
AngelList
Remote.co
Toptal (if it has design category)
Upwork(it was better when it was Elance and have Fabio Rosati as CEO)
Linkedin

At all of this places, you must create an outstanding from the crowd profile. be creative - who are designer? Or just find inspiration - get a template from other examples.
Read articles about how to build a profile at %name% website and what data to put.

Check some profiles, related to you or your work by topic(e.g. App Design, UI/UX, branding)


Dribbble and Behance - must have too. You can have intersections, it's not a problem.
Important to have categories, tags: logos, identity, icons, landing pages, etc.

I like this type of explanation at Behance [link]

I worked with Anastasia before, and I was impressed with results of her work.
We were like twins:
* she understand my requirements from a few sentences
* she uses all fresh and important design tools
* she knows how to work with JIRA and have a good design 'taste'.
* she structures design files well, so nobody tells's me - I don't understand what designer did here.


We did 3 projects in a row(different complexity) and I wouldn't hesitate to talk to her about other opportunities to work together. So we were in different situations and I don't have a lot comments how she can improve her workflow. From my side all was cool.




### Start do something
Next step is to start to write to a people.
From this step, you cannot hide by your images, profiles, previously completed projects.
You must answer a client's questions.



### Fin
I always like numbers. So if you send 10 message and don't get any replies - send 100 messages(but try to improve it). Then 1000.
Try to record what did you wrote, what people replying to you.
What they asking you. You can automate a lot of things here.

Prepare a document with different starter messages and add +1 for each one. Will share sample later.


### Notes

* If you have design for non-English language talking clients
you must translate all labels, titles, headlines. Because this can confuse your client.

* Create a set of smiling, head only images by professional photographer

* On next articles I'll publish a spreadsheet, where we tried to manage our sales process.
It'll be a big step forward if you'll set up something similar to it.
So clap and I'll understand that is important for you!

Take care and thanks for your time,
Arthur
