Self presentation is a key
I think that designer have more options to sell myself and my services.
If you are software developer what will you show? you code? its not easy to judge by your code.

Its important to have a organized and beatiful portfolio.
Don't make a screenshot and that it. You need to explain what was done.
How it was done.

Imp. note - if you have design for non-English language talking clients
you must translate all labels, titles, headlines. Because this can confuse your client. 

Each project must have detailed explanation. I mean really detailed. At least 5-10 sentences.
How much time you spend on it?
How it looks before?
What complex, but interesting things did you do?
Dribbble and behance it's must have. You can have intersections, it's not a problem. Important to have categories: logos, identity, icons, landing pages, etc.

I like this type of explanation at behance [link]

I worked with Anastasia before, and I was impressed with results of her work.
We have like a twins: she understand my requirements from a few sentences, she use all fresh and important desgin tools
she know how to work with JIRA and have a good design 'taste'.

Web full of places, where you can find a client

My preferences:
AngelList
Remote.co
Toptal (if it have design category)
Upwork(it was better when it was Elance and have Fabio Rosati as CEO)
Linkedin

At all of this places you must create an standing from the crowd profile
So read articles about how to build a profile at %name% and what data to put.

Check some profiles, related to you or your work by topic(e.g. App Design, UI/UX, branding)


Next step is to start to write to a people.
From this step you cannot hide by your images

Create a set of smiling, head only images by professional photographer

i always like numbers. so if you send 10 message and don't get replies - send 100 messages(but try to improve it)
try to record what did you wrote, what people replying to yourwhat they ask. you can automate a lot of things

Prepare a document with different starter messages and add +1 for each one.

Check my sample. this is a working data, that we use, when work at Elance like wordpress development service provider
