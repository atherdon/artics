мои список вопросов к парню, который хочет сделать фриланс бизнес предоставляяя услуги дизайна


self presentation is a key
я считаю что дизайнеру проще "продать" себя и свои услуги, чем например опытному программисту
Многие не смотрят на твой код
Важно иметь красовое, детально описанное портфолио. 
Просто сделанными скриншотами из фотошопа никого не удивишь.
Imp; note - если твои проекты работают не English language
нужно все labels, titles, headlines translate into English

Each project must have detailed explanation^
what did you do?
How much time you spend on it
How it looks before?
What complex, but interesting things did you do?
Dribbble and behance it's must have. You can have intersections, it's not a problem. Important to have categories: logos, identity, icons, landing pages, etc.

I like this type of explanation at behance

I worked with Anastasia before, and I was impressed with results of her work.
We have like a twins: she understand my requirements from a few sentences, she use all fresh and important desgin tools
she know how to work with JIRA and have a good design 'taste'

web full of places, where you can find a client

My preferences:
AngelList
Remote.co
Toptal (if it have design category)
Upwork(it was better when it was Elance and have Fabio Rosati as CEO)
Linkedin

at all of this places you must create an standing from the crowd profile
So read articles about how to build a profile at %name% and what data to put.

Check some profiles, related to you or your work by topic(e.g. App Design, UI/UX, branding)


next step is to start to write 

to a people
from this step you cannot hide by your images

create a set of smiling, head only images
by professional photographer

i always like numbers. so if you send 10 message and don't get replies - send 100 messages(but try to improve it)
try to record what did you wrote, what people replying to yourwhat they ask. you can automate a lot of things

prepare a docuemnt with different starter messages and add +1 for each one.

check my sample. this is a working data, that we use, when work at Elance like wordpress development service provider
