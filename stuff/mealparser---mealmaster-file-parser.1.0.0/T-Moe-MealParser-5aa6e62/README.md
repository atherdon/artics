MealParser PHP Recipe File Reader
================================

*A PHP parser for MaelMaster recipe files*

MealMaster is one of the top recipe management software. It's file format is used across all platforms and in a
lot of software applications. But so far it has been hard to import these recipes into a php application because
there has been no general-purpose parser but also custom-built importers for certain applications.

MealParser fills this gap by providing an easy-to-use interface for reading MealMaster recipe files.
