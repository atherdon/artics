With Fiberops, Alyasha rejects the current belt-printed, melon-colored and trust-funded t-shirt hype that defines modern streetwear, opting instead for a more subtle and sophisticated approach to quality cut and sew garments with a classic appeal.

Takeo Kikuchi,http://www.virtualjapan.com/wiki/Takeo_Kikuchi,http://store.world.co.jp/s/takeokikuchi/index.html,"Takeo Kikuchi is well known as a Japanese designer in both industry and fashion. His work includes the acclaimed Takeo Kikuchi clothing line as well as a wide array of eyewear frames and time pieces. Kikuchi’s role in the design of his clothing brand ended in 2004 when he stepped down from his role of head designer, handing over the reins to Taishi Nobukuni. Nobukuni has since gone on to start his own label but the time spent at the head of Takeo Kikuchi introduced a vintage/contemporary cross over style that rejuvenated the label both commercially and critically.
Takeo Kikuchi’s most famous line has been its menswear collection, developed after Kikuchi left his previous role as the lead designer of Mens Bigi, a highly popular men’s label in Japan. After it had been publicly pursued by World Co, a large apparel company in Kobe, Japan, the Takeo Kikuchi brand of menswear took off and became widely recognized as a top brand in Japan, quickly spreading its influence to Korea and China. The success was largely attributed to the uniquely Asian style of the cuts that combined the luxury of European styles and brands with the sensibility and fit of the domestic brands. After Taishi Nobukuni took over the creative lead at Takeo Kikuchi, the design changed to reflect the current streetwear culture in Japan, bringing in a sense of retro style that was previously unseen in the otherwise conservative label’s designs.",http://store.world.co.jp/s/takeokikuchi/common_official/img/h1_takeo_black.png,
