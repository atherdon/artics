Spend few days without computer

All functionlaity, ideas, flow and step-by-step plan was created just in few days without distractions.

Plan has detailed explanation.

a lot of blocking things was discovered.

for a first time i decide to remove all complex stuff and focus at Release #1 functionality only.
All other functions will be added and set up for a later times.

today i have some time, while was traveling in trainees
with a good mood i was starting to review my notes.
i decide to start to code in paper first.
So it's like you're trying to code functionality oa your head first and tring to solve problems with paper help later
if you did you plan well - you'll be able just sit into your chair with PC and code without any thinking.
just typing, debug your code and nothing more.
