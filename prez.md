как я пришел к идее разбить большой и сложный проект на 5-10 частей и запустить простые и не сложные oline tools
я учавствовал в 2х проектах like e-meals, делал online delivery(незапустился год назад, общался с инвесторами проект Nutricio и кучей мелких фаундеровб работающих в food tech category)

для маленьких проектов, когда owner is a chief and don't have a lot of skills in Tech

side, don't have skills in online marketing -> growing from 0 users and set up a first MVP it's not easy for them.


But as an owner, they might to master some skilss too. it other case -> it can takes a lot of time to launch and succeed
So using my knowledge (for developers each project is just database tables, software technologies, functionality, pages, sign up flow, etc)
i have this knowledge, and i knew a lot of 'icebergs' stuff.
So why don't just sit and set up my own project?
Not so fast! i need a content. As i'm not a chief, i cannot fill project with important data.


lorem ipsum, foo, bar is not works, because it's not easy to test.
So "Where get the data" was my first don't know item.
Second is - how to market it?
Third - how to build it

I start to work from scratch by using available for free tools.
Github is a good place to find that some functionality was build by other and they don't worry about sharing it.
You just need to know how to google it. So i start to collect a lot of links. [pic]
Where to store this links? 
I use Asana - it's a free management tool

start from there, where you can organiza your process.
I started with canban style board(which i like from times that i use @Trello)

how organized projects was looking in april for me

Then i decided to make my project lightweight and don't care about code style, design, forms, sign up process, etc.

Database was the only important key for building a good structure
but how to itteract with data?
I assume an API is a good way to build backend only first version of app.



So next step was to choose APi they how to build an API
Fast way for me(as i have create sign up process from scratch + building a CRUD makes me crazy too)
I choose IBM loopback.
It gave authoriation + they create a good structure with  CRUD stuff. it's works on Node, so i have a winner.
IBM report show that all new api builds at nodejs servers.

I find a good tutorial about how to master basics with loopback here it's [link]

And start to build a first version of recipe API database.

Good way to find an example of your structure(yes, your project is far from unique) at some developers forums, like stackExchange have: [link]

where i find a part of basic recipe structure(yep, it save a lot of my time)
you must be lazy as i'm ;)

after playing with this APi about 2-3 month i was stuck.
Paralized.

Yeah, i build it beforem but it's not easy to start something from scratch.

You must prioritize things, move to late stages any features, that came to your head, and make work only basic structure.

Again, data was an issue.
Yes, i was parsed some recipes and have basic & advanced strucutres. 
But it  was not enought and i have 0 energy to continue.

Then i findthis great website with grocery lists collections.
And i decide to start a fresh project, without 90% of previous functionality and make grocery list functionality with database structure that able only to store and display data from ulitimate list spreedsheet.


My plan was to build it in 1 month(pretty naive) but i learn a lot from there. I'll explain it later.
