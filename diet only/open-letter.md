So it can be a mistake and I can miss my target - not reaching a right person. Sorry for this.


I'm a software developer, and trying to build project that have intersections at
* food tech(leathy recipes, meal planning, fresh food delivery)
* fitness(routines, excercises)
* dietary management(dients, weight loss plans, food log)

I know how to code and i can google stuff like:
"best weight loss recipes"
"how to manage your diet"
"staying fit, healthy and eat well"
"maintain your body goals"

but my experience and knowledge are limited





First steps
i start to work on this project in April. it was a simple steps: i find a few database schemes, that was used at different projects
(don't worry - they're open sourced)
Has created a list of API, related to food and fitness.



Soon i'll check a competitors on market and will create a first business analysys.
What i want to get from you:
main interest to this topic
will to chat and share some details with me
list of products and features that use at your work.
what you want to get as result in order to improve your work personally.


My main goal to start understand how software can save your time, increase client number(maybe) and increase result of your patients(hope for this).

==============
so if you got this message by mistake and you're not the person who interested - sorry for this.

I can mistakely find you by keywords.

Not a better way to reach people, but don't know other way at this moment.






So let's tell that we need a simple working project with dietary functionality with food




I was asked - am i plan to find a co-founder? I'm not sure. If you want to be part of my project -> what you'll bring to the table?
Your experience? But is your experience stang out from other people with similar position?

I mean if i find you, can i find somebody else in order to replace you? if i cannot - state it somehow too.

Your users, clients/database? But if this project will be able to generate more users than you?
Please answer to this answer. Cause maybe i don't know something, so let me know.


Still interested?
let's continue.
I want to start from simple data enter.
I think this will be enought for a first release. All improvements will be implemented in next stages.

=========================
Short explanation first.



=========================




Ok, so user fill the data and you start to analyze it in order to create a diet plan.
Can you give me some hints about analysis process?

Analysis was done. Diet plan was created. What is next?
