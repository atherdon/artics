 Hello [name] and thank you for adding me to your network.
In order to speed up our chat and save your time i create an article with details about my project, explanation what i'm looking for and list of questions that i want to ask to you.
Take your time and check it when you'll have time.
There is no rush, so i didn't expect fast reply.

Thank you for your time,
Arthur

 -As mentioned - i'll create your website for free.
 -but i'll take your promise to grow your userbase, your revenue, etc.
 -i just hate when i create a website and later in 1-2 year it's just dissapeared.
 -so if you with me - it's a long shot. and also i'll require that you create at least 10 artciles to promote yourself and yourwebiste at medium
 -and we'll need to have more information, profiles and data about you personally. i mean you're your brand, right - so from this website we need to build a trust.

  food tech(healthy recipes, meal planing, fresh flood delivery)

  I know how to code such kind of projects.
  I also can google stuff like:

*"best weight loss recipes"
