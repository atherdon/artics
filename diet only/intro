-Just short info as i take your time:
 -i'm working at software project. it related to food, dietary and fitness. and coding part is clear for me - cause i'm a developer. but i have limited experience with other parts. so i need someone who can give me some feedback or answer to my questions

 -As mentioned - i'll create your website for free.
 -but i'll take your promise to grow your userbase, your revenue, etc.
 -i just hate when i create a website and later in 1-2 year it's just dissapeared.
 -so if you with me - it's a long shot. and also i'll require that you create at least 10 artciles to promote yourself and yourwebiste at medium
 -and we'll need to have more information, profiles and data about you personally. i mean you're your brand, right - so from this website we need to build a trust.
