Hi there!

Thank you for opening this article - I appreciate your time.

Most readers of this article were found at Linkedin/AngelList by keywords fitness, nutritionist, dietary management. So it can be a mistake and I can miss my target - not reaching a right person. Sorry for this.

I'm a software developer and trying to build project that has intersections at

food tech(healthy recipes, meal planning, fresh food delivery)
fitness(routines, exercises)
dietary management(diets, weight loss plans, food log)


But my experience and knowledge are limited


My main goal to start understand how software can save your time, increase client number(maybe) and increase results of your patients(hope for this).


Soon I'll check competitors on market and will create a first business analysis. What I want to get from you: 
* main interest in this topic, 
* interest to chat and share some details with me
* list of products and features that use at your work
* what you want to get as result in order to improve your work.

I create the list of questions to ask.
I split that questions into sub-lists.
After each question section, it'll be a link to a google form. 
So if you want to provide a feedback - feel free to fill the form.
You can reach me at LI, AL or post comment below. Thank you for your time.

What influences your choice when you pick a new recipe for a diet plan?
Do you create a database of new and healthy recipes relatable to different cases or do you write new recipes every time you need to create a recipes pack before you start building a specific diet?
Or …. do you have 100 recipes and you use them according to specific needs?
