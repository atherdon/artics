but i plan to create long document with details and explanation what exactly i want to build and what i'm looking for



Just short info as i take your time:
i'm working at software project. it related to food, dietary and fitness. and coding part is clear for me - cause i'm a developer. but i have limited experience with other parts.
so i need someone who can give me some feedback or answer to my questions


Sounds good. Tell me more about your project and what type of information you’ll need?

Are you looking for a co founder? Do you have a website or pdf to share your idea?


==============
Hi there!

Thakn you for opening this letter
appreciate your time.


Most readers of this article was found at Linkedin/AngelList by keywords fitness, nutritionist, dietary management.
So it can be mistakes and I miss my target. Sorry for this.


I'm a software developer, and trying to build project that have intersections at
* food tech(leathy recipes, meal planning, fresh food delivery)
* fitness(routines, excercises)
* dietary management(dients, weight loss plans, food log)

I know how to code and i can google stuff like:
"best weight loss recipes"
"how to manage your diet"
"staying fit, healthy and eat well"
"maintain your body goals"

but my experience and knowledge are limited


You can reach me at LI, AL or post comment here.


First steps
первые шаги в этом проекте я начал делать в апреле.
я собрал данные и сделал несколько структур баз данных, которые частично или полностью были взяты из других проектов(don't worry - they're open sourced)
я перебрал API которые занимаются едой и фитнес


Скоро посмотрю конкурентов на рынке и сделаю первый бизнес анализ.
Главное что я хочу получить от вас:
общий интерес поговорить на эту тему, возхможно вы расскажете какими продуктами пользуетесь вы в ходе вашей работе
и что бы вы хотели получить чтобы улучшить процесс ваш
как с помошью software можно освободить ваше время, увеличить количество клиентов(maybe) и увеличить результаттивность ваших пацентов(maybe).

==============
so if you got this message by mistake and you're not the person who interested - sorry for this.

I can mistakely find you by keywords.

Not a better way to reach people, but don't know other way at this moment.


What tools that you using online at your work?
What do you want to have at dietary management, weight loss software
What did you think cannot be done or improved?

So let's tell that we need a simple working project with dietary functionality with food
-> what top 5 functionality we must have from start, do you have a sample that can be viewed online?

Can you describe step-by-step process how you work with your clients?

How that functionality(first stage only) can be connected to a fitness tools, programs?

Calories counter, excercises time, etc?



ok, if you want to receive payments, what methods would you prefer? Can you explain why?
Do you want/must have recurring events?

What minimal connection diets must have with fitness and meal planning(recipes)


Can you share some little, simple diet sample for my review?
I assume that this sample can illustrate a basic, default flow...

is there any hidden, but important things? Please let me know, as i want to be prepared from start.
Hope not miss anything important...

========
What will be the first stage at communication between user/that want to start eat better food than before?


And you as nutricionist, befoe you'll be able to provide more personalized diet plan how do you analyse stuff?

what top3 or top5 most requested sutff from users you get or need?
