categorising thing



Akshay [7:37 AM]
i think our goal is categorize receipies or ingredients 
to its categories?



about categorization: in a long term goal, i want to have a ML algo, that will be able to create recipes that have an ingredients - that can be changeble
so i can have a recipe - that can work for ordnary people, for people with allergiers, for diabetics, etc
and if i apply that i have an allergy (example peanuts) - recipe will be alligned: it'll look on ingredient list and remove peanuts or switch to some other ingredients

it'll be cool if you can find an example about certifcate that will work for you - just want to
 understand that i get it clear and don't let you down

but in short term, i think recipe categorization is a complex thing
it have a lot of not clear "spots"
so i thin we must start from simple stuff
adn i think adding a department(ingredient category) is a good thing to start from it
example:

right now i have that ultimate grocerylist imported. 
with department ids assigned.
but what i'll must to do if i tell you that i have an additional list of ingredients, that contain 1700 items. 
and i'm to lazy to assign department to each ingredeitn by hands

Akshay [10:09 AM]
okay you mean first we have to categorize ingredients into their category for example milk-->dairy etc

Arthur [10:20 AM]
yeah
and then i'll be able to use it in my import
because before i add a category(let's name it department) 
by hand for each ingredient

Akshay [10:23 AM]
for simple i have list of all ingredients which 
belongs to dairy.. now what i am trying to do that if any ingredients comes which automatically goes to ingredients category.

Arthur [10:24 AM]
ok

Akshay [10:25 AM]
but remember for that i have to first train my 
algorithm on training dataset which contains almost 
all ingredients for that category.

Arthur [10:25 AM]
gotcha

Akshay [10:26 AM]
on testing phase if any of the ingredients comes from( what we have trained) will automatically classify it.
if this is okay,it wil be possible with good accuracy score.

Arthur [10:29 AM]
yeah - sound like a good plan
and not hard like classify recipes
do you need something from me?

Akshay [10:32 AM]
provide as much data as possible for better 
prediction if you have already.
yeah i got csv but have less data...i think i have to search for it.

Arthur [10:34 AM]
i have 1500 ingredients without department
will this work for you?
or let me find just ingredients related to diary only
i mean - i want to help - use me :slightly_smiling_face:

Akshay [10:38 AM]
if possible for all categories you want.
but that is complex for you.

Arthur [10:42 AM]
so for now it better to have more data related to 
each category, right
let's start from diary and then we'll go step bystep 
for other categories - is this ok?

Akshay [10:46 AM]
yeah..

Arthur [10:46 AM]
ok. i'm on it - will buzz you when i'll have that data

Arthur [1:36 PM]
find data
about diary itesm
item
preparing it for you right now
