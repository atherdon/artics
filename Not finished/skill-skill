Let's chat about FB login button. -> Maybe it should be in FB color scheme?

Not sure about Form at header.
I like it because it's easy to sign in.

But another is put just a 2 links - Sign Up Sign In - as a lot of startups did.
But this is debatable.

Important thing is related to recipes personalization of current user.

I mean by default - user should fill a long and stupid form with fields like allergies, etc.

I think we should have something more great. it'll give us more options to compete with other similar services.
