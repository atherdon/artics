this is some details for you:

Right now I'm exploring is somebody, who want to gain some experience at "startup marketing" can help me. 
So if you're interested to challenge yourself, this can be a good opportunity. 
As mentioned in title, I wouldn't be able to pay for this work. I'll try to exchange your help with my time and experience. 


This project has limited functionality for this moment. I plan to extend it, but before I want to get a feedback from the market. Maybe they just don't want to use it, who knows? 
So let's assume that tomorrow this project will be online. But how users will know about it? Where can we find new users? Right now, this project is free to use, but how we can add monetization? 
All of this questions we'll need to solve together. 


If you'll join me - you'll have a lot of freedom. You can quit where you want. 
You can work how much you want(i mean hours per day). 
From my side, I'll also create a good review for you(in any cases) at AngelList, Linkedin, where you want. 

Current version online here: groceristar.herokuapp.com 
The main action we have here with my developers: https://github.com/atherdon/groceristar
long story short: 
i need someone who will move GS as the project from 0 users to 100 free users, then 1000 free users, then paid users(maybe). 
This can be an awesome case for a young and bright talent because you literally will have 0 budget. So you cannot cheat with advertising, paid articles, etc. 
Only real steps, that gain real results. 






if you in - you'll get a lot of 
experience during this internship
