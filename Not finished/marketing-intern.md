this is some details for you:

Right now I'm exploring is somebody, who want to gain some experience at "startup marketing" can help me. 
So if you're interested to challenge yourself, this can be a good opportunity. 
As mentioned in title, I wouldn't be able to pay for this work. I'll try to exchange your help with my time and experience. 


This project has limited functionality for this moment. I plan to extend it, but before I want to get a feedback from the market. Maybe they just don't want to use it, who knows? 
So let's assume that tomorrow this project will be online. But how users will know about it? Where can we find new users? Right now, this project is free to use, but how we can add monetization? 
All of this questions we'll need to solve together. 


If you'll join me - you'll have a lot of freedom. You can quit where you want. 
You can work how much you want(i mean hours per day). 
From my side, I'll also create a good review for you(in any cases) at AngelList, Linkedin, where you want. 

Current version online here: groceristar.herokuapp.com 
The main action we have here with my developers: https://github.com/atherdon/groceristar
long story short: 
i need someone who will move GS as the project from 0 users to 100 free users, then 1000 free users, then paid users(maybe). 
This can be an awesome case for a young and bright talent because you literally will have 0 budget. So you cannot cheat with advertising, paid articles, etc. 
Only real steps, that gain real results. 






if you in - you'll get a lot of 
experience during this internship

As you sound like you interested in working together, I think I owe you some more details. So this will be a long message, and you don't need to send a reply on it asap. take your time, read it and tell me what do you think.

A bit of history.
Before I was working as an owner of the outsourcing company. We make a code for websites/projects for our clients. Our most successful example is nomoretogo.com we build it about a year. before it was working site with a base of 1500 monthly paid subscribers. when we rebuild it from scratch and launch - base was growing to 15k in 1 year. main work cost to our client 80k. it's maybe not a big money, but in Ukraine it is.
The second project, related to food tech built for 25k. So I think I know something related to food. ingredients, etc.
I was also connected to an investor from Chicago - who was on board of directors at Nutricio - another food tech startup.

as I told I have a few small projects in "development" stage.
The big picture is to create a platform, where the user will be able to get the similar project like nomoretogo or plan-it-dinner just for $1k in a year. or maybe I'll decide to evolve into something else :)
But building a complex project is complex, right? So I split my idea into a few "subprojects".

Right now food it's a big market.
You know that about 600 restaurants in Dallas(Texas) only don't have any online delivery functionality? For me, it's impossible in 2k18. I have the database of this places, build it with hands :) maybe we'll use it with you.

Big progress was made in building API, related to recipes - all I did myself only with my coding knowledge.



So any new startup, that works with food will have the basic database, related to ingredients, calories, food prices, etc.

Most of them will start from scratch and will build a database by hands of developers. And this is cool, but it can be improved and cheaper for the business owner. why reinvent the wheel all the time, right?


When I was working at API project I started to realize that I'm stuck with features, improvements, etc. I did before similar database architecture - but I was working for "salary", so when you have 0 - it's more complex to do. So I decided to split my project into a few.

right now I plan to finish and launch:
 "recipe search" - connect to a big recipe provider like AllRecipes or Yummly and by filling fields get search results.

"fitness profile" - you not only add how much you run or make other exercises, but you add how much weight you have, what do you eat, etc. I saw that a lot of small fitness girls opened websites where they help overweight people to manage their life.

"meal calendar": you have a calendar with an ability to add what meal you and your family will have at this week.

"budget planner": you want to track how much did you spend? add your purchases to the database and your management will be easier.

"gorceristar" - just a todo list of ingredients

I think I have some other ideas, but this is the main project that is in progress. As you can see - all of them can be bound together.

Regarding GS
Maybe another big improvement(e.g. feature, other sub-project) is about including small AI and re-invent the wheel of adding data by end users to our database. I really hate forms(build them a lot) and I think voice assistants, image recognition can help to avoid entering data in inputs.


For now, I plan to freeze development for this project. By Freeze I mean I'll active in management, but not touch code myself a lot.
But I'm working on building a team of developers, interns mostly. They main task will be not extended features, but "clean up" my codebase.
When I was building GS I was lazy, so I leave a lot of things for improving.


To be honest - I don't want to add features by my hands to this project, before I'll not understand that it's used by someone.
But maybe next easy-to-finish feature will be about storing data, related to prices. So when you go on your next shopping trip - you'll see how much your spending.


About Marketing.

Ok, if you're thinking about "right now GS is not ready" - let's add a beta-testing phase. So we'll not gain free users, we'll start from getting a feedback from strangers and try to update our plan with their needs. It looks like a smart move but only if you'll start to work on it :)


By using some research I'm also want to understand:
/ will this tool used by users
/ will businesses interested to add our tool like website feature
/ will be startups interested to take our code and save some time in building their prototypes.


If you ask me - I'm a bit pessimistic to GS right now too. But as startup owner is a good mood. I also wouldn't pitch any investor right now with this, current implementation.
BUT, if we'll add AI stuff and food order - it'll start to look like a company that has some valuation. So let's make it real!
