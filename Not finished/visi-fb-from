Get to know your customer really, really well.

And that is hard. For any size business. It‚Äôs as hard as it is vitally important, because everything you do, from developing your product, to marketing your product, to creating a brand that drives customers to you ‚Äì it all starts here.

To do that, you have to define who, exactly, you need to talk to.

And that starts by developing a hypothesis.

## intro

i like to work with hypothesises.
And tell me how i can give back something to you. 

üíó The Hypothetical Customer

‚ÄúI think my customers are moms, that want to create an online website/business related to recipes. The problem they have that I can solve is: it's hard and cost a lot to create this project from 0, maintain it, update...‚Äù

‚ÄúI think my customers are food tech startups, that usually pay salaries for creating a similar functionality. 
The problem is that each developer should spend some time - before will understand how to create it. But a lot of times This problem was covered a lot of times before. Web is full of examples. I gave up after 200 links" 


"I think my customers are nutritionists, doctors related to eating. they should use something more friendly. The problem is - they non-techies too, and don't like to change hourses"


So you think this is enough for cover another mystical question, like - "Buyer Persona Face"?

Go ahead, take a stab at it.



This is the easy part! You‚Äôve created or at least ideated your company with a customer and solution in mind. Now comes the hard part: Validating your hypothesis, or chucking it into the bin.





List everyone you know who ...
this is an easy part for me. because i like to ***** on numbers.
So usually i starting from 100 and then extend that number.

Not a caller person. And locals is not a good for testing too(i assume)
Good catch about gift cards and help in back.


Ask them these three things:

What jobs do you need to do around [what your industry/product/problem is]? Have them walk you through their process and record the exact words they use. For example, if you‚Äôre selling an HR solution that helps companies hire qualified people faster online, the tasks a business owner, manager or HR person need to do is create a job posting, sort through resumes, figure out interview questions, and spend hours interviewing people.

What‚Äôs hard about those jobs? Let them rant about how hard they work and what grinds their gears, how they‚Äôve failed or got outcomes they didn‚Äôt want. Record everything.

If those issues were magically solved ‚Äì what do they love about their jobs? What would they love about their lives? What would solving that problem allow them to do with that time instead?

Sure, there are a million and more questions you could ask ‚Äì but these three focus on what jobs these customers need to do, what their pain points are surrounding those jobs, and what their ideal outcomes are.

The answers you gain will start to show you some truths about your hypotheses.

You‚Äôll start to see that some kind of ‚Äòideal customers‚Äô are more ideal than others.

You‚Äôll check whether the problems they have match the problems you think they have.

You‚Äôll compare the language you use to describe those jobs and problems with the language they use.

And you‚Äôll uncover insights you can‚Äôt even begin to guess at right now.

You may have to go back to the drawing board and re-write your ideal customer hypothesis ‚Äì and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs progress.

And you‚Äôll definitely come away with language you can use for marketing ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the most valuables takeaways of this exercise.

üíó Don‚Äôt be Lazy

Why can‚Äôt you just send a survey? Hey, that‚Äôs the reaction of most founders, too. Really. If we all agreed to just keep things simple by communicating via text message and Slack, we‚Äôd have more time for everything else. But believe us when we say: You need to hear their words.

In person, if possible.

he-he. Guilty as charge. 
But i love to be in my —Ä–∞–∫–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞




Yes, it takes time and it‚Äôs nerve-wracking and uncomfortable. But it‚Äôs worth it. People will not tell you on a survey what they will say to your face. They won‚Äôt even tell an employee of yours the same thing they‚Äôll tell you, the founder. With an actual conversation, you‚Äôll be able to ask in-the-moment follow-up questions, listen to the tone of their answers and put their words into an emotional context, and most importantly ‚Äì you‚Äôll be starting a relationship with potentially ideal customers who might become your first customers. Your best customers. Customers that will adopt early and advocate for you.

All of this comes from person-to-person communication. You can‚Äôt survey it away.



üíó Keep it Short

A few rules for polite customer research:

Keep it short ‚Äì stick to 15 or 20 minutes. It‚Äôs enough to get deep information without scaring people away.

Make sure every question you ask is actionable ‚Äì as in, if you don‚Äôt plan to act on the information you get, don‚Äôt waste time asking the question.

Avoid yes/no questions. The goal is to get voice-of-customer data, which means you need to let them speak and not put words into their mouths.

Don‚Äôt take anything personally. These people want solutions to their problems, and maybe you have them, but even if you don‚Äôt, they‚Äôre giving you valuable feedback.

Show appreciation somehow. This doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy or expensive, but it should be personal and helpful.


üíó Sort Your Answer Pile

In the course of customer research, you‚Äôll speak with people who may have seemed like ideal customers at first, but then clearly were not.

And others who aren‚Äôt so clear. They could go either way.

The answers you need most are the ones from your ideal clients, and to make sure you‚Äôre sorting the Ideals from the Non-Ideals accurately, ask yourself this:

If I gave this person my product/service/solution, could they successfully use it to reach their ideal outcomes.

This is a Customer Success approach that I really like because it sets you up to work with people who are primed and ready to love your product (and tell their friends about it). It‚Äôs also a way to avoid The Product Death Cycle.
