When I'll complete other tasks at this repository - I'll assign it to you(as i did it here). And add badge - "help wanted". You'll be able to review that tasks, ask questions if something not clear - as we did here.
Btw, we still will need to find a right tool for working with schemes/diagrams, so when you'll have time - please try that second tool.

I'm working at different time zones, so it's not easy to catch me sometime, but if you would ask a question at this issues(and use @atherdon mention) - i'll receive notifications and reply when i'll have time.
I also have a bad habit - I can go into a stealth mode sometimes. When I'm working on something complex and be over distracted - I shut off all my communication channels, so if i'm not replying - then i'm working on something. Just let you know


it's ok - feel free and ask me anything - this is my main goal to create a good work environment for each team member.

Second note - this work must be fun :)
So if for example, you'll be bored with this diagrams - you tell me and we'll pick another task for you.
Everything is negotiable and related to a comfortable teamwork.


I might not be very fast but I will make sure I do good work for you.

you welcome. fast is not what I expect. you'll have as much time and attention as you'll require. my goal is to create new coding machines from my interns. I did it before, so it's only up to your hard work




s there any specific time and task going to assigned for me? Or is it upto me?

No. all is up to you. I mean you have a full freedom here.
Work when you want, spend as much time as you wish.

Same with the situation if you decide to finish our collaboration - just tell me that you're quit and that it.
And an any results - i'll create a good recommendation letter for you and will try to help to find a full-time, in-office job.
