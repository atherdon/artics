categorising thing


about categorization: in a long term goal, i want to have a ML algo, that will be able to create recipes that have an ingredients - that can be changeble
so i can have a recipe - that can work for ordnary people, for people with allergiers, for diabetics, etc
and if i apply that i have an allergy (example peanuts) - recipe will be alligned: it'll look on ingredient list and remove peanuts or switch to some other ingredients
---

but in short term, i think recipe categorization is a complex thing
it have a lot of not clear "spots"
so i thin we must start from simple stuff
adn i think adding a department(ingredient category) is a good thing to start from it
example:

right now i have that ultimate grocerylist imported.
with department ids assigned.
but what i'll must to do if i tell you that i have an additional list of ingredients, that contain 1700 items.
and i'm to lazy to assign department to each ingredeitn by hands

okay you mean first we have to categorize ingredients into their category for example milk-->dairy etc
@TODO Check with Te about this stuff.

Arthur [10:20 AM]

and then i'll be able to use it in my import
because before i add a category(let's name it department)
by hand for each ingredient

Akshay [10:23 AM]
for simple i have list of all ingredients which
belongs to dairy.. now what i am trying to do that if any ingredients comes which automatically goes to ingredients category.

---

Akshay [10:25 AM]
but remember for that i have to first train my
algorithm on training dataset which contains almost
all ingredients for that category.

---

Akshay [10:26 AM]
on testing phase if any of the ingredients comes from( what we have trained) will automatically classify it.
if this is okay,it wil be possible with good accuracy score.

---

Arthur [10:29 AM]
yeah - sound like a good plan
and not hard like classify recipes
do you need something from me?

---

Akshay [10:32 AM]
provide as much data as possible for better
prediction if you have already.
yeah i got csv but have less data...i think i have to search for it.

---

Arthur [10:34 AM]
i have 1500 ingredients without department
will this work for you?
or let me find just ingredients related to diary only
i mean - i want to help - use me :slightly_smiling_face:

---

Akshay [10:38 AM]
if possible for all categories you want.
but that is complex for you.

---

Arthur [10:42 AM]
so for now it better to have more data related to
each category, right
let's start from diary and then we'll go step bystep
for other categories - is this ok?

---

Arthur [1:36 PM]
find data
about diary items
item
preparing it for you right now
