Hi guys, welcome to my course %name%

My name is Arthur. I'll be your teacher.
I'm building my own startup, related to meal planning.
So in my classes you'll build stuff related to food.
Usually this work makes me hungry - so be ready!

This course is for beginners, with basic knowledge of HTML.
We'll not be able to cover all topics here. But I'll try to give you a lot of different information and later you'll be able to extend your knowledge
and advance your skills.

It'll be an interesting journey. I hope you'll fun and reach the end. Ok, so let's go to work.
