a class on CSS - Yes, I can do this, just need to think about the plan. I have a presentation, related to Flexbox, we did it with my friend because in his office a lot of people didn't know about it. I also can think about Bootstrap 4 - because I'm a big fan of it.
HTML - maybe, it's not hard
Git - I think it should have 2 topics Git + GitHub. And it's more about practice. Because I saw that a lot of my interns know Git basics, but never broke any repositories before. So it should be focused on practice class, in my opinion.
Javascript/jQuery, SASS - yep, we can do basics. SASS is also can be mixed with Bootstrap - because you can teach about how to create a good elements structure by showing samples of Bootstrap modules.
Node.JS - tell me what exactly do you want to have? simple CRUD+mongodb, or creating APIs? right now I'm exploring how to create an npm package, so this can be another class too.
React.JS - only basics. nothing advanced, because I'm mastering it right now too. 


I should create a txt file with basic recipe data, like image url, etc.
in the middle of the course we should have page with half of elements. like short version of recipe page.
