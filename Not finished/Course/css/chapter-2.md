  
  #### Div with elements inside
  we'll add 2 styles in order to make divs looks like blocks
  
  #### Floating
  Usually you can use it in 2 states
  `float: right`, `float: left`
  
  let's add some more content inside our blocks:
  
  Block1
  ```
  {
    color: grey; // it's for text color
    background: black;
  }
  ```
  
  Block2
  ```
  {
    color: magenta;
    background: grey;
  }
  ```
  By applying float left to a block 1 -> we'll see how it change it position
  
  #### Margins/ Padding
  with this rules `padding-left: 10px;` `margin-left:10px;` you can add invisible borders to your elements
  margin give you invisible borders between elements
  padding give you invisible borders inside the element.
  
  <div class="black"></div>
  ```
  {
    color black
  }
  {
    color yellow
  }
  {
    color white
  }
  ```
  let's add paddings to yellow block
  let's add margin to white block
  with this example you can make text inside the blocks displayed in the middle of the block.
  this rule is `margin: 0 auto;` it's a short version of `margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0; margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;`
