Hi campers, nice to meet you here.
I was around this project but was to shy to post my question here.

First important thing - my job is non-paid.
Second - it’s a remote job, but i think this is not a problem for digital nomads, right? we all using gmail, slack, messenger, github, asana, etc - that help us communicate.

Common questions

Why it’s non paid? because it’s an early stage startup and we have 0 in our bank account. I’m also not working, so cannot share earned salary.

Can I share an equity - which is the common way to do a work at startups? I agree, but i don’t want to make a false promises, you know. I mean % of 0 is still zero. I plan to dig into topic, related to equity sharing, but it’s really complex thing. especially at my homeland.

How we can manage our work?
It’s not a brainer. I have a team of developers before, i think i have project management skills. All stuff is open sourced and all tasks are stored at GitHub issues.

Why you don’t code it by self
I did. I worked on this project more then a year, and it’s boring. I also see that other team members give a big boost to my personal work. And I a lot of tasks i’m lazy to do. I mean I code more than 5-6-7 years, and i don’t want to debug some small things.

So if you want to gain experience at real-time project - welcome aboard. there really no restrictions at this moment.

About positions and working skills. To be honest - any helping hand is appreciated!
So i’m ready to teach you, if you don’t know something.
I’m also want to learn something new with you!
Right now i’m trying to dig into Bot development and Alexa skills development.

More details about what i’m doing:

Will it be a stealth startup if i’ll explain what i plan to do?
