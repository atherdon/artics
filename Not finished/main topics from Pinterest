short version. just context.


I want to convert pinterest images, related to grocery lists into csv or 
json like arrays. one of my prev interns started to do this, but he start a 
complex project at work, and don't have time to help me. we have code at 
repo, some details, images where you can test how your algorythm works. 
language is python

repo is here: https://github.com/ChickenKyiv/ocr-grocery-parsing

i'm not 100% sure about final structure of result array. because current GS database structure will be updated soon(i assume)




we get a db from some europe open sources and right now we have database of 5k ingredients with nutrient data info(more than i expected) 
https://github.com/GroceriStar/tensor-something 
there a csv file at root


----

In ideal world result should be something like this
https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar/blob/master/bin/grocery/departments.js
https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar/blob/master/bin/grocery/ingredients.js

So basically i need ingredients, that related to some department.
like Milk related to Dairy
