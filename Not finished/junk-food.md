ultra-processed food products 

What are the health implications of the increase
in group 3 food products? As yet we cannot know,
simply because the classification used here is
new. However, many products in group 3, such
as soft drinks, biscuits (cookies), ice creams, pastries,
processed meats, cheeses, and sauces, are
already identified as increasing the risk of obesity
and other nutrition-related chronic diseases. In
terms of nutrient profile, such products are typically
energy-dense, and contain a lot of added
sugar, sodium, saturated fats or trans fats and
little dietary fiber

Sugared soft drinks are a special case. Evidence
of their harmful effects to health is now
disputed only by industry representatives and
apologists. To date, six systematic reviews have
found associations identified as causal between
what have now in many countries become typical
levels of soft drink consumption and increased
calorie intake, overweight and obesity, and serious
diseases of which overweight and obesity are
a cause

About 90% of the items available are unhealthy, the paper states, with candy accounting for 40% of offerings. And though supermarkets, supercentres and convenience stores offer more snacks at checkouts, there are still plenty of unhealthy options at stores that sell toys, clothing, home and bath supplies, hardware, books, electronics and sporting goods.

Many businesses may in fact be exploring ways to boost sales of snack foods at checkouts. Increasing checkout purchases in “power categories,” such as beverages and confectionary, by 1% could earn a store an extra US$15 350 a year, according to a recent study, Optimizing Checkstand Merchandising.

Advertising to children is widely regarded as ethically problematic. Young children cannot distinguish between advertising and editorial or entertainment content; and older children, even if they rationally understand the selling intent behind advertising, are often still subject to its emotional and unconscious influence.

Junk food advertising, which is linked to increased child weight and obesity, sharpens this ethical issue, compounding it with health concerns. From three years of age, children recognise more unhealthy than healthy food brand logos.

Eat with other people. We too often eat absent-mindedly. We don’t even notice that we’re distracted by the TV or computer or newspaper or the like. Eating with other people is fun and food is meant to be communal. The more you eat with other people, the more you’re going to engage with food and cook with and for other people. Because let’s face it, when you’re cooking, everyone congregates in the kitchen.


Give yourself a break. Eating a healthy diet of simple, whole foods is hard work. Be proud of what you’ve accomplished and try to not be so hard on yourself. I really try to avoid treating any one food or ingredient like it’s evil. Experience dictates that total abstinence rarely works especially in the long run. And try not to judge what others eat. People are different. One person may have success with a style of eating that may wholly contradict the next person’s philosophy. It’s okay to enjoy occasional treats too, without fear and without anxiety. Eat it mindfully and enjoy it openly. I’m indulgent as I am disciplined and you can easily catch me with a croissant with my coffee as you can with a salad of beans and leafy greens.






how can you try to eat more healthfully in our junk- food-filled world? Here are three tips:

Choose fast-food restaurants that offer healthier choices. And no matter where you are, opt for food and beverages that are made up mostly of ingredients that offer nutrients along with calories. Enjoy freshly squeezed orange juice or a whole-wheat bagel instead of soda or donuts. Buy a bean burrito, pizza topped with vegetables, or a grilled chicken sandwich on a whole-grain bun instead of tortilla chips with processed cheese sauce; frozen pizza rolls; or fried chicken pieces and French fries. Avoid sweetened beverages.
Look for products low in sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, milled grains, and partially hydrogenated oils. Choose a 100% whole-wheat cracker made with canola oil, for example, or snack on a cheese and fruit plate instead of a bowl of cheese puffs.
Limit TV viewing, for yourself and your kids. Certain TV shows seem to attract more junk food commercials more than others, so parents might want to discourage kids from watching these shows. Or try TIVO (where you can fast-forward through commercials) or watch DVDs.
