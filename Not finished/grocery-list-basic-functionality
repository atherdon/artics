Weekly menus - recipes - remove recipe - change servings - changes at GL

Main Weekly Menu(created and stored by chief)
Cloned to user section if user want to add some changes
When user remove recipe, change servings, rearrange recipes order, replace recipe to another - Menu copied to user collection and weekly menu id updated from Main WM to Cloned WM

GL
* add
* created from Main Menu(nothing was changed)
* created from User Menu (GL not saved to db in this case)
* if user want to add some products to GL - we create GL related to User Menu for this week
* when user check ingredient(we assume he buy it) - this ingredient moved to Purchased. Purchased must have this information: qty / Date / notes/ place where it was buyed.


create functionality when user uncheck ingredient from GL - so we need to remove it from Purchased list too.
