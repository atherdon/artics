What i'm doing to ascuire first users.

Hope they will be paid subscribers, soon or later.

Ok, I hope each of you read a lot of interesting startup stories. They work hard, have done bad steps, good steps.
Then BOOOOM! and they became some big names.

Not so fast :) Hold on.
97% of projects/companies die at the first years. A lot of cool projects strugle without promotion/marketing that will be equal to their code quialty.
It named Walley of Death.

Ok, so I assume i'm at it. Yes, I launched(enabled online non-buggy version of my project)
And what? And nothing/ yeah, my friends registered - as usually... @Denis Petrov did. But @Betty Olivera not :(

  But i don't get any feedback, etc. You can tell me: But what did you expected? You should promote your product, At least submit it into Product Hunt. The problem was -> i don't want to promote it. I want to be in my comfort zone.
  Another thing related to quality, functionality of this version. I'm a developer. I built a lot of complex systems. And I know that my project not ideal. YOu can read my concerns [here]

  This called a professional degradation. You have like a scoring system. And it based on your experience. So, by my experience - it's a not best product. So I have it works, just with 0 users.

  Few days ago something triggered inside me. After chatting with few sales interns i start to realize that i should start to work on sales. I did it before. I have that skills, first steps are not brainer for me.
  So with that passion - Let's start to grind!

I'll not put here all this important, but not necessary things like Mission?Visual/ User Persona, etc.

Only hardcore moves, that i'm doing right now.

If you need to hunt a rabbit - and you don't die by hunger -> you just went and kill it.
Simple, huh? You don't need to read "How to kill a rabbit. Second edition.", "6 steps, that will give you a rabbits", "Rabbits. What they do? How they think?"

Maybe this will be fun and helpful to someone.
Briefly about projects.
Recipes. Meal palnning, food grocery shopping.

path1 = build a 'starwing crowd'. YOu need to find 150 places in order to promote your startup and find a real users with real problem.

Ok, where i can find more than one clients?
Recipe forums, website for Professional Chefs, Moms forums, Reddit sub-redits. Quora...
Ok, I googled. Didn't spend a lot of time, but store website links.
At least 100 links i have. I assume 50 will not return a result. Bad, but this is how we ride.

Then I think "Ok, recipe is such a big field. Let make it less common. Ok, Vegan recips will reduce a lot of search." Next idea -> Where I can find a place, with a lot of small recipe based websites? Where a lot of moms spend time? Pinterest(by my opinion, for sure)
So i opened it. Put vegan recipes in search and grab at about 400 links. Sure, few of them will be duplicated, some of that broken, but this is ok.

Next step is to build a database of leads. And start a sales routine.
In order to have great mood - you need to work on that things each day. no rush, no emotions. if need money asap - then just calm down - you already failed it. Start to be like a robot.

Sp building a list of forums and recipe websites in one day - is a bad thing. Took a lot of energy

Next problem related to sending letters. I don't like calls, scheduling at another normal things, so emails is the only way for me right now. But how to handle big amount of letters? how not to get crazy with big amount of different people, how not to hang yourself, by opening your Gmail Inbox?
you'll find this on the next part.
