What I'm doing to acquire first users.

Hope they will be paid subscribers, soon or later.

Ok, I hope each of you read a lot of interesting startup stories. They work hard, have done bad steps, good steps. Then BOOOOM! and they became some big names.

Not so fast :) Hold on. You need to know that 97% of projects/companies die in the first years. A lot of cool projects struggle without promotion/marketing that will be equal to their code quality.
It named Valley of Death(I didn't name it)

Ok, so I assume I'm going through this Valley.
Yes, I launched(an enabled online non-buggy version of my project)
It was a few months ago. I did it like another lean startup advising -> you need to have ugly MVP that you ashamed of.

And what? And nothing.
Yeah, my friends registered - as usually... @Denis Petrov did. But @Betty Olivera not :(

But I don't get any feedback, etc. You can tell me: But what did you expect? You should promote your product, At least submit it to Product Hunt. The problem was -> I don't want to promote it. I want to be in my comfort zone.
 Another thing related to quality, a functionality of this version. I'm a developer. I built a lot of complex systems. And I know that my project not ideal. You can read my concerns [here]

This is called a professional degradation. You have like a scoring system in your head.    And it based on your experience. So, by my experience - it's a not best product. So I have it works, just with 0 users.

 A few days ago something triggered me. After chatting with few sales interns I start to realize that I should start to work on sales. I did it before. I have that skills, first steps are the no-brainer for me.  So with that passion - Let's start to grind!

I'll not put here all this important, but not necessary things like Mission?Visual?User Persona?Positioning? etc.

Only hardcore moves, that I'm doing right now.

If you need to hunt a rabbit - and you don't want to die by hunger -> you just went and kill it.
Simple, huh? You don't need to read "How to kill a rabbit. Second edition.", "6 steps, that will help you with rabbits", "Rabbits. What did they do? How they think?"

Maybe this will be fun and helpful to someone.
Maybe I'll pick some advice here. It'll be cool to get help.
Briefly about projects: Recipes, Meal planning, food grocery shopping, diets, healthy eating experience.

What I'm going to do.

Path1 = build a 'starving crowd'. You need to find 150 places in order to promote your startup and find real users with the real problem.

Ok, where I can find more than one clients?
Recipe forums, a website for Professional Chefs, Moms forums, Reddit subreddits. Quora...
Ok, I googled. Didn't spend a lot of time, but I saved website links.
At least 100 links I have. I assume 50 will not return a result. Bad, but this is how we ride.


Path2. One-to-one email communications


Then I think "Ok, recipes are such a big field. Let make it less common. Ok, Vegan recipes will reduce a lot of searches." Next idea -> Where I can find a place, with a lot of small recipes based websites? Where a lot of moms spend time? Pinterest(in my opinion, for sure). I opened it. Put vegan recipes in search and grab at about 400 links. Sure, few of them will be duplicated, some of that broken, but this is ok. I'll be ok to get 20% replies and only 4 interested website owners.

It's a **bad** conversion numbers, but it's better to be pessimistic and prepared for now.

Next step is to build a database of leads. And start a sales routine.
In order to have great mood - you need to work on that things each day. no rush, no emotions. if need money asap - then just calm down - you already failed it. Start to be like a robot.

So building a list of forums and recipe websites in one day - it was a bad thing. Took a lot of energy.

Next problem is related to sending letters. I don't like calls, scheduling at other normal things, so emails are the only way for me right now. But how to handle big amount of letters? how not to get crazy with the big amount of different people, how not to hang yourself, by opening your Gmail Inbox?
you'll find this on the next part.

I'll need to have a list of template messages - that I'll search at first times, before getting a reply and we started real conversations.
I want to have at least 5-8 first "open messages". Something simple, not complicated.
Not pushing people to decide if they want or not work together
