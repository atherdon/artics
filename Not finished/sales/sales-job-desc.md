So we'll setup a similar process with you.

Did you use Hubspot sales?
As I have some tricks from prev. company -> we'll automate a lot of things with you(hope for this)

You'll need to get that data from me and create some sort of a plan(we can discuss it)

I assume we'll pick one of 'assumptions' about of the future clietns and will by to create a 'starwind crowd' from our upcoming product.

Do you want to learn how to operate a sales process in startups or other companies?
So it's a good deal for you. I don't have cash, this is an early stage startup and we're strugling without clients, that need our help.
I'm focused on software development process, management & hiring. I don't want to change that and run sales myself.

But! I know how to do it. And i can teach you. So, if you interested and want work hard, and for free and take a lot of pressure -> let's try this.
Your test field will be my company. YOu'll lose me some cash, but i'm ok with that right now.
YOu need to try and apply to this job, but you'll need a lot work to do.
