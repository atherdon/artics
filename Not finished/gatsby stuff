i didn't use gatsb before. but it have a good structure for a start and
ability to use graphQL. i assume that tutorial is fine, because for now we
didn't build a rocket. just a few pages with a few elements. nothing
complex



1. Read more about React Starter - Gatsby(https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
2. install the first version of the project on your local machine and push changes into this repo
3. set up build stuff(maybe it works from the box, not sure, not remember)
4. try some local changes
5. move your current setup into **i forget the name of service**
6. add link to online version at readme file
7. ~~blog thing~~ buzz me at this point
2.1 for sure you need to commit your code here.

## Requirements
