About time: everybody at my team have a full freedom right now.
As i cannot pay for work right now - i cannot rule, you know :)

But this is a good approach i think. Because I can filter people. Work only with team members that really want to work and gain an experience.

Sketch is good. I also like to use invisionapp, because it really informative tool for developers.

Good to know that remoteIntership working for getting more attention to my job offer.

Btw, i like your project at behance. Do you have another samples at your portfolio?

## Details

Please tell me, after reading more about my projects/modules, what will be the most exciting part of design work for working together? 

i see how i can use your skills, but want to know more about what you wish to do.

I'll use this knowledge in order to give you a future tasks.

You'll not the first developer at your team, so for a first time you'll have separated tasks from other designers. Maybe later I'll megre you with other team members.

if we're talking about groceristar project, first version was released and can viewed online.

It's bad i know. 

I didn't spend a lot of time on thinking about how elements must be presented. 
My main goal was to launch fast, and maybe right now is a perfect time to make it looks like a nice and friendly product.

Tasks that have my attention right now(related to design): 
* create a wireframes for recipe based app(we have a lot of data, but must have a finished visual) 
* create a nice UI for Groceristar - i was in rush and didn't spend a lot of time for make it looks cool. yu can see it here: http://groceristar.herokuapp.com/ 
* building a first version of dietary management tool. don't have a proper idea about how it'll looks. it's like an open frame right now.

Our work can go by two paths: 
1) you find what is more excited for you, pick one in-process project 
2) i can create a detailed list of things, that is important for me and i'll 
manage your work.

what do you think?
