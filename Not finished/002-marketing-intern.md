Groceristar looking for remote marketing intern(non paid).


[
So any new startup, that works with food will have the basic database, related to ingredients, calories, food prices, etc.

Most of them will start from scratch and will build a database by hands of developers. And this is cool, but it can be improved and cheaper for the business owner. why reinvent the wheel all the time, right?


When I was working at API project I started to realize that I'm stuck with features, improvements, etc. I did before similar database architecture - but I was working for "salary", so when you have 0 - it's more complex to do. So I decided to split my project into a few.

I'm exploring if somebody, who want to gain some experience at "startup marketing" can help me. If you're interested to challenge yourself, this can be a good opportunity. As mentioned in title, I wouldn't be able to pay for this work.
I'll try to exchange your help with my time and experience. Maybe i can teach you => move some mt experience into your head.


Groceristar has limited functionality for this moment. I plan to extend it, but before I want to get a feedback from the market. Maybe they just don't want to use it, who knows?
So let's assume that tomorrow this project will be online. But how users will know about it? Where can we find new users? Right now, this project is free to use, but how we can add monetization? We'll need to solve this questions together.

If you'll join our team - you'll have a lot of freedom. You can quit where you want.
You can work how much you want(i mean hours per day).
From my side, I'll also create a good review for you(in any cases) at AngelList, Linkedin, where you want.

You can see how current project looks here: https://vimeo.com/260263675
Yes it looks badly, but we're updating our desing at this moment. Details [here].

The main action we have here with my developers: https://github.com/atherdon/groceristar

Brief:
I need someone who will help to move Groceristar as the project from 0 users to 100 free users, then 1000 free users, then paid users(maybe).
This can be an awesome case for a young and bright talent because you literally will have 0 budget. And t's quite challenging task. So you cannot cheat with advertising, paid articles, etc. Only real steps, that gain real results.






if you in - you'll get a lot of experience during this internship

As you sound like you interested in working together, I think I owe you some more details. So this will be a long message, and you don't need to send a reply on it asap. take your time, read it and tell me what do you think.

Story behind my projects, read here

You may learn from this tutorial about my prev. background.
There an explanation what and how i'm building my software.

as I told I have a few small projects in "development" stage.
The big picture is to create a platform, where the user will be able to get the meal planning software just for $1k per year. But building a complex project is complex, right? So I split my idea into a few "sub-projects".

Right now food it's a big market.
You know that about 600 restaurants in Dallas(Texas) only don't have any online delivery functionality? For me, it's impossible in 2k18. I have the database of this places, build it with hands :) maybe we'll use it with you.

Our team made a big progress in building recipe API server. We can sell them to our clients too.



right now I plan to finish and launch:
 "recipe search" - connect to a big recipe provider like AllRecipes or Yummly and by filling fields get search results.

"fitness profile" - you can add:
 how much you run or make other exercises
  you add how much weight you have
   what do you eat, etc.

   I saw that a lot of small fitness girls opened websites where they help overweight people to manage their life.

"meal calendar": you have a calendar with an ability to add what meals you and your family will have at this week.

"budget planner": you want to track how much did you spend? add your purchases to the database and your management will be easier.

"groceristar" - shopping list of ingredients -> can be a service for recipe website owners

I have another ideas, but let's discuss it later.

[[[[[Mre about our projects is here]]]]]
All of this projects can be bond together.






About Marketing.

We can postpone product launch- if you wish.
We can run a beta-testing phase. So we'll not work on getting free users, we'll start from getting a feedback from strangers and try to update our plan with their needs. It looks like a smart move. We can discuss it.




By using some research I'm also want to understand:
/ will this tool used by users
/ will businesses interested to add our tools to their like websites
/ will be startups interested to take our code and save some time in building their prototypes.



 So let's make it real!
