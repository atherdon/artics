Release 1.3 was covered very well.

Tasks can be splitted into a few categories.

Easy and small tasks - any one can do it, who can grab a code from repository. And setup a local version without big troubles. And can spend some time for reviewing and debuggin routes - can start to work on this tasks. 
If something is not clear - questions welcomed at comments sections - and i'll explain in details what we need to do.



Second step of small tasks require some previous knowledge of product(you should swim a bit in our code - before starting to work on it)

Some of tasks still not separated and form small backlog. I form a two groups: easy and complex task for later(they can be started after working on second part of tasks)
