Right now i didn't prepare a good explanation about requirements/duties of my designers, but as we at early stages, i assume this is ok.

I have a lot of content to share with new members, that will give you more information about what is going on.

About using Invision app for creating wireframes of future recipe app.
So le'ts move my "screens"(i assume we need to recreate an app wireframes from that
and create an interactive version of sitemap. this sitemap will be used by our app developers
so they will better understand what we're doing and what user experience we should recreate

another idea is to create a design for our app, by using some of UI design templates that are in the market.
i mean first versions will not be so custom. so we can just use a similar layouts...


Stage 2 for invion app wireframes will be to extend that created pages with features, that we plan to add in future releases.

For a first time i'm ok to have that wireframes without designers
Just Elements, blocks, text will be fine.
my goal is to start using it asap in our app development process.

About design - you'll be the 4th design intern in team, but this is not a problem because we have a lot of work todo.
I can share with you few quick tasks - that came to my mind:
* i created pages at groceristar without design. and it looks bad. it works, but this is not what i have in my head.
* i want to speed up smartphone app development, and i'm trying to create a wireframes. i make some good progress. but i think it'll be better to use your design skills. I have a sitemap, i have a screens of previos app that i develop.

but if we'll start - i want to start from something simple. I mean for now it better to finish few small things, instead of something big. So i think we need to discuss what do you want to do or what do you interested to do. and i'll adjust my plans.

share with me your behance account
