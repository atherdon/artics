What do you mean what project I want to take? What kind of project do you have?



at my article i tried to explain that i have a few projects, with similar functionality.

I tried to build a custom complex system from the begining. But i was stuck and decided to create a project with modular system. 

So i'm building a few small projects - fix some code problems, create and test structure, and when it ready - i can include that functionality into main - big project.

Main idea was to create a Saas project that will help recipe builders to create a website where they can sell their services. Services like meal planning, diet management, etc.

For example: GroceriStar is a sub-project, it's only about creating and managing shopping lists. When codebase of this project will be ideal - i'll move it into main project - where grocery list management is a part of functionality.

My question is if you have any previous studies about how to design the page, I need that info. However, if you want me to start from scratch, I will forget about what has been done and work from the beginning alone.

got it

i just assume that you open my repo and figure out that i have another designers too

right now you the 4th member of a team

but, for app - we didn't do a lot of design work

it was more about researching, functionality, etc - what i can do myself - i did it

but i cannot create a cool design - this is why i need a lof ot help

i have a lot of things in my head, and i'm trying to create some sort of document with good explanation, share roadmap, etc. and i'm working on it right now

-------------

ok, when are you planning to launch the product?

it's about our/your work load or something else?

if we're talking about recipe app

it depends on developers

i'm trying to make their life more easy

and create some sort of releases plan. and a lot of things was done and solved by my hands a lot of time before

so if we'll release Free Menu version
i think coders can spend not more than 1-3 weeks on it

and time depends only at our communication level

next releases will require some additional attention. but few complex things was solved by me too

it's hard to explan

for me it's easy to show by what was done at my code repositories

------------------------

ok, let's start from some intro: groceristar have a one template. with shopping list items: like milk, beer, vodka, etc

since few weeks (as very less time with active job)
can i see that template

and i think that adding another few templates will add some value to my projects

sure you can

so, i find at least 200 links with different shoplist templates

template is in text file or excel file?

biggest trouble is how to get data from some other sites and convert it into proper javascript array.
it can be text, it can be image, etc
it's hard to create a regular expression, etc


it was first ML-like topic
another idea was to teach model to convert measurements

because it's very tricky to have like teaspoon, lb, ounce in one place
glass/spoons image in your medium link?


but measurement stuff is a long-shot
not very ready right now. just my research
so i propose to start from grocery lists

hold on will find ultimate template
http://www.grocerylists.org/ultimatest/
grab it from there
i convert it by hands into this files: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar/tree/master/bin/grocery


scrappy tutorial - maybe it'll be a good thing

ok it helps to import data from websites/link
and scrap it

no it;s not my site. but current version of my project is ugly too
but right now i have designers in team, so...

if you are scraping someone's site, did you get permission from original author/website?
or not needed?

btw, this excel file is imported into my database - so you don't need to convert it - not sure if this is clear

i contacted main owner of this website - he's not replying. still waiting on fb invite
and i'm put in thngs at credit. don't want to be a bad person

http://www.grocerylists.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/grocerylistsDOTorg_Editable_v3_4.pdf
https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar/blob/master/credits.md


and when i start to form a list of 200 links - i contacted one website owner and tell him that maybe i'm stealing their data and ask if they want to figure this out. they star a conversation and then go away. 

i plan to have a cross link for each website that we're using - it also will be good for seo

no, there excel download file

you can combine ingredients into grocery lists


so, i find at least 200 links with different shoplist templates" instead of creating more template, isnt it possible to add items in existing template?

how templates are seggregated?

which 200 links you are talking about?

cann you share those with me?
https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar/issues/417

it's possible to add items into template
but people are lazy, i assume

it's not a task for you
but maybe it'll helps

let me complete that task
guide me how to compleete it
so that i can learn by work
ok

open a part1 subtask
and start from it

https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar/issues/418

i am here
i assume first result of your work will be excel-like file with data from that links

so this links are samples
you need to review them and grab data that we need
right now we need only departments and ingredients

www.allyou.com/food/one-list-five-meals/meal-planner-hearty-dish

i opened first link
what to do next?
what is department?
department is food category
so milk have department dairy



"Page Not Found"
for this case it's easy
you need to move that data into excel format
if link dont have information that we need - you should specify that in comments
at github taks
can you check comment?
and reword if needed?
do you mean right now or later?
now
yes i get a notification

do you want me to reply ?
i want you to check my comment,
is it ok?
for now is perfect
do you need information/comment in that way?
ok

i mean i dont have any plan at this moment

but I see that at least i can add numbers to the links and this will help us to understand each other
https://www.vegan-nutritionista.com/vegan-grocery-list.html

this one is looking for some money
should i specify same in comment?
yes numbering system is needed
yeah

or one should at least comment inline.
let me number it

there no rules right now - everything is evolving when we're talking with you
how to number it
that is fine
i like random people like you
they are more creative, open and honest

so we'll find a way how to get to result
so maybe - before we'll go into scrapping or ml you should just open that links and form some sort of plan

you had said 200 links, rightnow list is around 10 to 15 only

maybe it'll be better to have an excel file with "link", "status" headers
yeah, this is why i call it part#1

hmm

let me check other parts
ok found all links in other parts
but what is your plan, if there is downloadable template whcih needs money to download?
are you ready to pay them?

and i think i didnt move all links from my pc into github issues
no, i'm not ready to pay. because i have 0 in my account

so you are focussing only on free content now a days
if we don't have a free template - we skip it and move to the next option
right?
ok

and maybe later i'll contact website owner - we partner and he/she give me that list for free
do you have plan what if there are multiple similar recipes?
where

how to remove/prioritize
at https://github.com/ChickenKyiv

not get your question
let us sayi added recipe X
you added recipe X1
both recipes produce item # Y

one is good another recipe may not be good enough
or may be duplicated
by item # Y you mean ingredient?


nope
output product
still not clear

ok forget it
we may discuss it later
tell me what is next thing i should do now

what is yoru plan for me?
what should i start?
create an issue on github and explain it there. so we don't lose it. i care about any improvement
ok
later

you'll forget it - i can bet on it
do you want to see my to do list?
it is too much dump
wil i be scared?
yes of course

how much items you have on it?
many different things

unorganized way
i store at least 5000 links in my browser and i really need them
ok, about task
nic
e

what do you think we can do with this links?
will you be interested to help me with them?
because sometimes i think i should do them by my hands
but it's really dumb

first of all there should be provision that there should not be any duplicate links
if you are really interested to collect links for your project, you (we) should create a web crawler.
but
source are different

so yo'll need to create a new rule for each website
and content are different too
a web crawler can work automatically

as you know - there no rules about how to wrap that stuff in html
i think so
i'm ok with webcrawler if you can do it

i can try once scrapy tutorial is finished

so in total 2 crawlers
1) to collect links
2) to collect inforation from those links

ok second item may not be called a crawler instead it may be called as scraper
ok, so this will be our plan i like it
i'll create a separate repository for you - because this repo is messy
maybe later i'll clean it up






i mean a lot of data that i have and know - it's open to use
but most of them are in our slack workplace - i can add you if you want



it'll be cool if scrapper will works
yes it is alwayz fun to see robots in action

----------------------
For sure, it's not a big deal. All is located at github - it's open sourced :) 

Stack: Nodejs, Loopback Framework for API, React/Gatsby starter for static files, React Native for app. Alexa skill with JS SDK, machine learning with python 
MongoDB, Github as code repo & project management tool

Bot development - > Botkit Framework, recast.ai(separated)

maybe i forgot something...


------------------------------------------

Thank you for your kind words
It's my job to be initiative :)

## about full-time job
To be honest - i don't have anyone who looking right now a developer.
Maybe Forest Admin company - i chat with owner a few month ago. they just get an investments and extending their team. but again - no promises here.
But as my work is non-paid and i hate this - i'll put all my power in order to help you to get a "real" full-time in-office job.
I have a big networks at AngelList and Linkedin - and i want to help. I really mean that. 
So in any cases - when you'll decide to finish our work - I'll create a recomendation letter for you. You can use me as reference and you'll be able to show your code.

How i can see this: you can pick some companies, that you want to join - and i'll write to top-management of this companies. Will be able to promote you. i did it before for other interns - so this is not a problem for me.
As i'm "CEO" too - usually my opinion is count.

As you can see - i also have an recruiting experience - so i understand how this process works - and will try to help you to get more attention.

## workflow
Another thing - you have all freedom here. we can discuss your tasks and if you don't want to do it - we can find another task for you. so anything is negotiable. and communication is the key of our work.

Main communication will be via email/Messenger/Slack
I hate calls - so we'll not setup any meetings :) if you have a question - send me a message - when i'll be awake or ready to reply - I'll try to help you.

Tasks will be managed via Github.

## hardware 
i have some wishes to create a device too, but again i think this is not a good option for you, because you must find a job with salary, but want to let you know.


## Questions


>> how can i get recruited? 
it's not an easy answer because any company use a different ways for hiring process.
I like angellist - it's give me more options. So setup a cool profile for you - will be important
LinkedIn - must have too.
we'll talk about this a bit later. i'm not prepared right now.

>> can you help me? 
tell me if this question was not covered 
>> do you know any such companies/connections? 
yes, but it always an individual way. 

>>  i wish you can connect me to them. 
I will, without any restrictions.

---

>> Since i am curious so much, i am ready to start anything. 

We need to discuss and find a work that you'll be ready to do and also you'll be happy to do. Boring job - it's not for me. if you'll get bored with my projects - tell me and we'll find something else.


>>Can i see your to do list/activities? 
yeah, all projects is opensourced and all tasks is visible for anyone(some thing are in my head or at my walls)

I think we should start from picking a project where you'll work on, so i need to know what sub-project is more inspiring you at my article.
this is my github account - you can take a look: https://github.com/atherdon


>> So that i can choose from it?
yes you can.

if you'll work with Machine learning - your toolset will be enough. if you'll work as JS dev - you'll need to setup a basic nodejs related things.

>> With my current job i am unable to focus on my dream/passion 
I think i'll be a good example for you - because what i'm doing - following my dream. and it's not easy - i have some big troubles before - but i'm still keeping my dream at my head and moving forward. maybe my example will help you too. hope for this.


>> is not helpful/exciting for me. 
Same for me. only practice and spending "ass-hours" digging into the problem.

>> i can offer you is passion/traction
i'm ready to teach you so this is what i expecting.

>> independent startup
I hope i can help you somehow with this.
because this is what i'm doing at this moment. it's hard, but fun - so if you want it - you should try. because anything is possible - and this is not just shitty fancy words for me :)

Thanks,
Arthur
