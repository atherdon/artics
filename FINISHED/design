but if we'll start - i want to start from something simple.
I mean for now it better to finish few small things, instead of something big. So i think we need to discuss what do you want to do or what do you interested to do. and i'll adjust my plans.



another idea is to create a design for our app, by using some of UI design templates that are in the market.
i mean first versions will not be so custom. so we can just use a similar layouts...
