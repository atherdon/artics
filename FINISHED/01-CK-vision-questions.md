>> Just assume that you want to create your online business,
based or related to 'recipes topic'
it can be just a simple site, where you're posting a recipe that
 you create and generate revenue from google ads
or you can create a 'fitness plan' for some of your trainees,
 who want to lose some weight and look better
or you want to create a recipe service, your own startup where
 you'll post each week recipes bundle and make your users live easier
or maybe you're just want to store your mommy recipes and later
 publish a book with her favorite recipes? Who knows?

>> So we're trying to make you're life easier!
We also can help to save some money. We build recipe websites - we know that this can be tricky.

>> Most of our products are separate and free.
So if you don't want to spend money,
or you want to play first without subscribe to an enterprise plan
 - you always can grab one of this projects and start to work on your project!

>> I think it's a good deal, Huh?

>> I tried to build a custom complex system from the beginning. But I was stuck and decided to create a project with the modular system.

So I'm building a few small projects - fix some code problems, create and test structure, and when it ready - I can include that functionality into main - big project.

The main idea was to create a Saas project that will help recipe builders to create a website where they can sell their services. Services like meal planning, diet management, etc.

For example, GroceriStar is a sub-project, it's only about creating and managing shopping lists. When the codebase of this project will be ideal - I'll move it into the main project - where grocery list management is a part of the functionality.

1. ChickenKyiv is a meal planning software. Imagine a busy mom, that have 3 kids, husband.
She can have few goals:
- kids always want something different and cool to eat
- save time and money
- keep personal healthy goals
- create a yummy meal for her husband

2. How does it help you stay healthy?
as you have a meal plan for a future week, with recipes, that was approved by chefs, you can be saved by eating healthy(if you strict to the plan)

or if you're on diet - it's important to track your calories and don't miss food intake

3. How does it help you save money?
Better planning usually helps to save cash. if it related to food - you sometimes is better to buy 0.5L of milk instead of a liter. And it'll not be wasted.

4. In what stage is ChickenKyiv currently?
Hard to explain. It's not finished and not launched.
But the first version was completed about 1 year ago. The first idea of this tool was to create a simple recipe app, and ChickenKyiv was a place, where all data stored, list of methods that can be called by an app.
there always a room for improvements. I think with the second release we'll go public. because I find a way how to create a recipe based website when you're not a recipe creator.

5. What future plans do you have with it?
In the previous year, I just want to replicate a functionality that I was build before. maybe make it better, maybe advance it.
But for now it's boring, so I'm trying to add some new and exciting methods/technologies in order to create something that I didn't see before or make it more advanced.
with my team members - we trying to reimagine a meal-planning, try to create it like a product that we'll use 365 days in a year

6. How is it different from other products that help you stay healthy?

It depends on what we're comparing with.
You know that web is full of recipes? So why you do not create a different meal each day?
Do you know that eating junk food is bad and better to eat plants? why we have a lot of over-weight people that really cutting years of they life?
it's because of we people - we different. and it must be a lot of different solutions for different problems.
