Whenever the two words food and technology come together, most people
directly think of concepts like genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and John Deere
farming tractors.
Sure, GMOs are the most logical link between between biological lifeforms of
consumable plants and animals. And it does make sense to think that technology caters
to building the most advanced farming equipment, and methods.
You must be thinking then, “What is out there that I don’t know?”

Well, there are technologies now here with us, that are dedicated to print our
food. We are even able to 3D print our own candy! The ChefJet, as it is called, prints
candy cubes and shapes from sugar. It is used to make cake toppers and
embellishments as well as creating structural and artistic candy shapes.The 3D printer
is also available for personal use, and are easily available to buy at its online retailer.
While they are out of the box technologies like that, people tend to overlook
those technological additions that make our lives easier. It was not long ago since
recipes had to be passed down to younger generations, and one had to squint their
eyes to be able to read their elder’s hand writing in an old recipe book. Now, isn’t it
great how many different flavors we can acquire through the famous AllRecipes?

Also, what type of device did you use to order that late night pizza?
It not really about knowing, it is more about acknowledging and opening your
eyes to what is right in front of us, and being excited of how seemingless it is and (for
future products) will merge to our lives.

We are beginning to be part of the most innovating transformation that the food
industry has gone through. I call you to be part of it, pay attention, and welcome to see
how many more innovations improve upon our experience with food. Remember, it is
not only about agricultural production.
