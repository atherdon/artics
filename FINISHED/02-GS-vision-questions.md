## A
1. GroceriStar is online shopping list(+ where you can store items that you need to buy) 
----
2. if you tracking your meals - it's important to buy fresh, healthy products. with a shopping list, it's easy to do.

3. if you using grocery lists - you always save your money - because you can avoid impulse purchases

4. release #1 was shipped. the first version was launched. Development work is continued in different ways: separation frontend and backend, brandbook design was finished, updated homepage styles - implementation was started, a lot of project management work was done, at least 3 people working on machine learning thing, where we can bring additional value to our customers, when saving a lot of data from personal purchases. I'm also exploring a way about working with Alexa enabled devices. but right now not a lot of progress was done. but one guy was hired for that position.
big next thing will be an extended database structure, separate logic, and static pages and clean up my code
-----
5. basically GS is part of ChickenKyiv. so in long term, this two projects will be merged. 
but it can evolve into something more than just sub-project. 
after realizing that borders are only in my head - I start to dream about what can be really disruptive, and the current version is not what I see.

-----
6. not different. more limited than other products. but I don't care. when you have 0 users - it's not important I think. 
by science research - with shopping lists, you manage more your body and what you're eating. I read at least 2 papers about this study. but it was only women study, so it's not clear. Btw, I think the main impact to health goals will be only when meal planning software will be launched

---
7. as I'm not a pro at cooking and cannot create a content - I get an example of the shopping list from the web. and I plan to add other templates soon. this template can be separated by different types: clean/healthy food, diabetics, any-popular-diet-name. the main goal of this templates - don't start shopping list from scratch. clone it and add or remove unnecessary items. timesaver.

---
8. it's for all internet users. but it also can be used by other startups. there a lot of food tech companies that build these things each time from scratch. I want to change that. I mean - it's better to do it one time and focus on building space rockets. so all things are open-sourced and visible to the public. we didn't hide anything and trying to keep this approach

## additional questions

7. So we begin with why do we need such a website? (edited)
8. Why sharing your grocery list helps?

## answers

7. There a lot of websites with similar logic and with better functionality. But what is making unique - it's me. I have a previous experience, want to make things easier for users and I assume I know how to do it

8. You can share it with your family, so they can know what you need to buy. instead, to call and ask - hey, I'm in the grocery store right now - what should i buy?

## Less nerdy answers

3. The first version of GroceriStar was launched online. You can see it here [link]
We continue our development process and will extend current functionality. Soon it will have more features, less ugly.
Next releases will add more *value* to our users.

4. Simple online shopping list. Nothing more.

5. I want to add prices fields. so when I buy something for the first time - I put the cost of this item into the system. A second purchase, when I'm creating this shopping list from home, I can have a preliminary estimate about how much this will be.

6. I have a modular vision for this project. So instead of making it standalone - I want to integrate it with other projects, related to meal planning.
7. I think online delivery will be a next important feature. so you create your grocery list here, then you can open a delivery website with pre-populated shopping cart. it can save some time.

8. right now I'm focusing at the US. but there no borders for other countries.
