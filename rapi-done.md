Completed or in-progress parts.
Let's assume that i made it online available.

Right now it's a different projects. Later i plan to convert them into modules that will became a big & complex platform


1) Free Menu (Recipes) App - Angular + Ionic Framework - 
# Release #1 compled: recipes list, recipe details.
Note: soon i'll redo app from scratch. 

2) Stripe subscriptions dashboard
In my previous projects we have problems with recirring events, so i pick Stripe at this time in order to simplicity.
# Release #1 completed
Basic functionality: 
- Sign up process
- Pick a plan + Billing
- View profile + Billing settings
- Switch subscription plan
- Subscribe / unsubscribe
Note: User sensitive data not stored on our server for security reasons

Note: in the end i want to enable Recurly integration - because it better but paid. Will work only for a big clients


3) API for meal planning Apps(simple version) - so any who have credentials can use our data or store date in easy way no matter of programming language
# Release #0 compled. Release #1 started. Partially completed by option#9 
- Authentification
- First database scheme
- Save data into db. Data manipulations.

4) Simple Finance Tracking tool(exspence tracking) - how much family spend per week? How meet financial goals, etc.

5) Meal Planning App(2nd generation or option #1) build with React Native help

6) Simple(without options to configure) admin dashboard.

# Release 1 can be completed after binding with option#3 logic
Note: later i plan to switch to Forest Admin startup. 

7) API Documentation (Messy, not completed, can be extended)
# Release #1 80% completed by option#3

8) For each of this projects i created step-by-step plan. Create releases plan with tasks
Trying to simplify things, manage myself, made this approach working
# Stage 2: For 2 projects PM work is done for at least 3 month

9) Grocery list(Shopping list) only web app(got other open sourced codes and mimic it at my implementation)
- Simple add / list / edit / Delete categories and items
- All code and structure are from my head or by my googling skills.
- Have simple API, can be combined with mobile app

10) Advanced search functionality
# Research finished. Release #0 will be completed after binding with database from option#3

11) Unit convertions (research stage)

12) data parsing(deep research page with previous completed functionality knowledge)

I didn't plan to limit myself with functionality that was build at previous projects.
Things going forward, and some features are outdated.
