Completed or in-progress parts.
Let's assume that I made it online available.

Right now it's a different project. Later I plan to convert them into modules that will become a big & complex platform


1) Free Menu (Recipes) App - Angular + Ionic Framework - 
### Release #1 compled: recipes list, recipe details.
Note: soon I'll redo app from scratch. 

2) Stripe subscriptions dashboard
In my previous projects we have problems with recurring events, so I pick Stripe at this time in order to simplicity.
### Release #1 completed
Basic functionality: 
- Sign up process
- Pick a plan + Billing
- View profile + Billing settings
- Switch subscription plan
- Subscribe / unsubscribe
Note: User sensitive data not stored on our server for security reasons

Note: in the end, i want to enable Recurly integration - because of it better but paid. Will work only with big clients


3) API for meal planning Apps(simple version) - so any person that has credentials can use our data or store data in our database no matter of programming language
### Release #0 completed. Release #1 started. Partially completed by option#9 
- Authentification
- First database scheme
- Save data into DB. Data manipulations.

4) Simple Finance Tracking tool(expense tracking) - how much family spend per week? How to meet financial goals, etc. 
### Research stage completed. 

5) Meal Planning App(2nd generation or option #1) build with React Native help

6) Simple(without options to configure) admin dashboard.
Main feature -> add a recipe to DB. Drag them to Weekly Menu. Publish, send weekly menu notifications.
### Release 1 can be completed after binding with option#3 logic
Note: later I plan to switch to Forest Admin startup. 

7) API Documentation (Messy, not completed, can be extended)
### Release #1 80% completed by option#3

8) For each of this projects, i created a step-by-step plan. Create releases plan with tasks
Trying to simplify things, manage me, made this approach working
### Stage 2: For 2 projects PM work is done for at least 3 month

9) Grocery list(Shopping list) only web app(got other open sourced codes and mimic it at my implementation)
- Simple add / list / edit / Delete categories and items
- All code and structure are from my head or by my googling skills.
- Have simple API, can be combined with mobile app

10) Advanced search functionality
### Research finished. Release #0 will be completed after binding with database from option#3

11) Unit conversions (research stage)

12) data parsing(deep research page with previous completed functionality knowledge)

I didn't plan to limit myself with functionality that was built at previous projects.
Things going forward, and some features are outdated.
