at my article i tried to explain that i have a few projects, with similar functionality.

I tried to build a custom complex system from the begining. But i was stuck and decided to create a project with modular system. 

So i'm building a few small projects - fix some code problems, create and test structure, and when it ready - i can include that functionality into main - big project.

Main idea was to create a Saas project that will help recipe builders to create a website where they can sell their services. Services like meal planning, diet management, etc.

For example: GroceriStar is a sub-project, it's only about creating and managing shopping lists. When codebase of this project will be ideal - i'll move it into main project - where grocery list management is a part of functionality.
