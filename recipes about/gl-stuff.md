Feat: autogenerated grocerilist


Note: At previous this releases, we have screens with ingredients list — right now auto-generation(convert recipes data to grocery list) is not working.
In order to use this functionality, you must have another one file with Grocery List items only.

It’ll be generated on the fly — at next stages.

We must have unit conversion module
We must have quantities inside our ingredients or items
