projects AKA Food Tech: database structure, basic troubles to be ready for

### Where similar database structure can be used Где может использоваться данная(схожая по строению) структура базы данных
At this post i tell a bit about my project

* recipe based websites(allrecipes.com)
* food loggers(ex. + shopping lists like GroceriStar)
* dietary management / Weight loss
* restaurants data, cafe, etc (menus + ingredients management)
* order delivery
fitness projects (fitbit tracks your water and know how much calories was burnt)

Online shops(fresh markets, meat, farmers food)
Alcogol/Cockails/Beers bewerage allrecipes
Family budget planners

### Basic troubles, that you'll face when you create recipe website (non-technical)

*data entering
*photo/video content creation and checking their quality
*chat with users, resolving emergencies
*making universal meals with ingredients without any restrictions(alergic, seasoned food)
*working discipline, discipline at other topics(marketing for example)
*management of development team
*Business management(payment bills, refunds, other business rutine)
*social media stuff: posting, profile creation, articles creation, art side, etc.
*Out of money and cannot keep going forward
Make product without proper documentation
