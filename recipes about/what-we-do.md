“recipe search” — connect to a big recipe provider like AllRecipes or Yummly and by filling fields get search results.
“fitness profile” — you not only add how much you run or make other exercises, but you add how much weight you have, what do you eat, etc. I saw that a lot of small fitness girls opened websites where they help overweight people to manage their life.
“meal calendar”: you have a calendar with an ability to add what meal you and your family will have at this week.
“budget planner”: you want to track how much did you spend? 
add your purchases to the database and your management will be easier.
“groceristar” — just a todo list of ingredients
