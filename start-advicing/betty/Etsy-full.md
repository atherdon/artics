About Investments=============

My contact, investor from Chicago, tells me a good method, related to investments.

When company trying to get seed, all moneys don't go to company financial account, as usually. Funds going to lawyers account, that will manage your progress. This method ties owner hands, and this is not cool. But this reduce probability of failing. You cannot burn all money and "die" without cash with this option.

I name this method - "escrow investments account".
So, when you get seed money, you must separate your work with this money. If(when) you catch your goal - you can get next part of money.
Law firm must check your results, and you'll get your money if they approve that you hit your goal.

In this case you and your investors will be more calm, because you'll know when you'll got money and what will be next. If i'll start to look for investments from vc, I'll try this way - really good way to manage vc moneys.

=================================

Design section. ===========



3) Homepage design cost: $600-$1200
All pages and elements must be explained on paper before start. This will save bunch of time for designer. Also this will save money. Homepage design costs contain
* logo update, if needed
* custom icons pack, can be used on different pages
* typography
* Main color scheme for website

Inner pages design: $300(each page). This is minimal amount.
This cost will work only, when designer exactly know what he need to do.

I propose to use this formula for calculation how much money can cost custom design.
This formula give us a maximum value - most bad option, when all is going wrong.
If design process will be managed well. design cost can(read must) be reduced.

Design cost: $1200 + $300*n*1.4*1.2

n - number of inner pages(some of pages can have duplicated functionality, which can save some time)

1.4 - additional 40% for unexpected situations

1.2 - additional 20% for management costs(someone who will manage and interact with designer with PM skills)

Note: Design must be created in 3 different resolutions. This will save time to frontend developer. He will know how website will look at tablets and mobile devices.
So, each page must have 3 psd files: desktop-version, tablet-version, mobile-version.


Designer must convince owner, that website design have latest trends in internet. With good design, we can solve problems of heavy pages.

Ex: Imagine PayPal main payment form. It have 12-18 fields. it's a big pain for users to fill it. Then check how payment forms looks at mobile platforms - design can deal with heavy functionality. This can save time for users.


5) Design for application. Below I put some links, that can help to launch "good looking" application.
Why application? It can add more value to clients, suppliers, investors. it will also increase strategies to interaction with users. Before design for application will started - we need to have list with all pages and elements on each page.
So good idea to build alpha version of application with "default simple design". This application will have all functionality, but without sharp design. Later, when design for application will be done - we'll need to add styles in code and user will be able to use it.

Please check UI kits, that I put below, they can save about $800 for application design. Using this UI kits frontend developer need to convert them to HTML/CSS3 and move this styles to application code with "default simple design".
Other great point - with UI kit - you can save a lot of time.

Most detailed UI kits was build by Invisionapp team:

https://www.invisionapp.com/now
https://www.invisionapp.com/relate

Note:
Designer must have at least 5 years of experience and take part of creating design for startups and projects, oriented to US market. This is a big difference between local website designer and designer for competitive markets.
He must have portfolio at behance, dribbble account and use invisionApp and task tracker.

=====================

Team:

1) Tech lead, backend developer, frontend developer, designer, tester, project manager, finances manager.

Tech lead will cover development results

PM will feel gaps between owner, developers, specification. Without PM you'll face a lot of issues: delays, budget extensions, misunderstandings. All tasks must be(very important) stored in task-tracker(JIRA, Asana, Basecamp) and PM must to know how things going at project using trackers. So questions, discussions wouldn't lose, tasks will clarified and owner can see how things at project development going in real time.


=====================

======================

Technologies

When I describing technology stack, I assume that project development will be outsourced to one for companies in Ukraine.
Talent market, prices, all this information based on information from Ukraine market. In other situations - you can chose other technology stack.


If you'll find a good tech lead - he can advice you about different technologies.
I've tried to abstract from technical language and explain everything by human language - this document must explain development process. This will help to avoid misunderstandings, mistalks. So both sides(owner and development team) understand what they want from each other and what must be in the end.


-----------

It's important to create project sitemap, before software development will started. In that sitemap you need to draw pages hierarchy and what will be on this pages(simple explanation of functionality)

It's important to have list of all pages, that must to be created. Ideally, if you also explain in text each elements on each page.
Usually, during development, this list will be extended, but with this list you'll avoid situations, when some pages "missing", because they was not discussed. This list will be useful for owner too, because it can be used as checklist of how development is going. Owner must go due all steps, check that all functionality working well, find "bottleneck" places, discuss what must be completed, removed, improved, etc. It's important, because developers wouldn't use this project later.
It'll be good to get tutor for owner: study how admin side working.
Ideally, project must have administrator, but owner also must understand how to operate website.

-----------


It's not easy for developers to catch updates for different payment systems.
So if you need to include PayPal, Autorize.Net and Square - developer must have previous experience with that payment gateways.

=======================

Plans, organized by amount of investments.

a) BBC get funds, equal or more than 2x for software development. In this case you can start to think about full project development. Time for development: 5-6 month.

b) BBC have 10% of project development budget. In this case - you need to focus on important features on website, look for other investments and sales from project.

—Å) BBC got 1% of budget for development. You need to create revenue streams with high margin. You must find out, what your users need, want and can afford. On this case you cannot handle huge amount of data. Because this will distract
In this situation I'll propose to work only with       wholesale suppliers. This way is high-risky, but you can grow fast. You cannot afford to think about website development, because you haven't money for do it right.


Note:
A lot of big companies have "startup programs", like Microsoft. They can help to save first money on development related costs: advertising, hosting, etc.

Hosting environment.
You must use hosting with developer friendly "stuff". You need to buy hosting with ability to setup server from scratch. With full access to work on it. Setup emails, databases, backups, etc.

AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku, Linode - right candidates. Have similar functionality

Pricing similar too: $10-$20 per month. So for first year you must have $250.
My personal choice: Linode or Digital Ocean - they have different method for server setup, but each experienced developer can cooperate with them easy. This will help you to cover important parts of development, as code version control, migrations, staging version setup, roll-in/roll-out updates, testing, backups. etc.


----------

You must to explain, how user will work with BBC. It's name - User story. Step by step. Just imagine that you explain how will work BBC to someone, who don't have a good skills in Internet. I imagine that I explain functionality to my granny :)

You must to explain, how client will work with BBC.

Maybe you need to check how this was covered at all.biz, amazon, etsy. This can give you a lot of insights.

It can be an opportunity if you'll create and manage a simple job board/craigslist - this can generate additional traffic and attention to BBC.

Any option for increasing traffic can be reasonable. Especially, if this is easy to do and cheap. If this system are self sustainable and don't eat a lot of time for support.

Later this functionality can be removed, or mimic to separated project and generate additional money.


----
Get attention for big companies.

Successed history of completed              stories will be important for them. Long story short - they must to know how much money you can generate them. If you don't know - it will be not easy. So BBC must have good story, nice show cases.
How you can get this good story.


In any option - showcases - it's important part            for big companies.
For small companies any sales growth - it's good, because they don't have a lot of sales funnels, usually.
Cost for get attention of small companies is lower. They have low pricing, this is important too.
Small companies don't spend a lot of time for thinking. Big company must run a lot of meetings, before they make a decision.



================

Create a simple procedure for adding           "paying links" to BBC for big companies.
Imagine data, that must be imported and related to iPhone:
images, video, tech specs, product attributes( color, data storage, etc.) additional accessories( cases, earPods, etc. )


For simplifying database development process I propose 2 stages: simple - that will working well for small companies and will be limited for big companies, complete - will work well for big clients.




=======
If you'll have a lot of data, you'll need to solve problem related to static content hosting.
Right now this is not an issue, don't need to worry about. This is problem of fast growing company. But you need to be ready, so this wouldn't be a surprise for you.

======

Users workflow===========

What your users can?
Only review information, buy products?
Or they can help to promote BBC or find issues and make some money from it?



---------------

I think we need inner dashboard with some functionality:
Manage users, who can manage whole website(Admin user role)

Manage users, who can manage content website(Editors, Reviewers user role)
Business management
Images management



statistics with visitors, other tracking information
notifications, tips, help section, support for logged/paying users



Admin side for Main Admin Role
User management with ability to switch session to user account. This can save time, when you'll help to restore password or with something else.


languages management, translation management.
Content management
Pages management
Support workflow
Blog workflow

-------
Notification system
Later can be integrated with push-notifications in application



-----
Emails:
You should create plan for email campaigns
Setup 'follow up emails' system

SendGrid/Mailchimp/Mandrill for email campaigns(mass mailing)
You also can create and invite people to sales events from Facebook pages. Really cool method to be engaged.

You can use emails for marketing, sales, tips for sellers, share coupons, emails for free-trial period, registration emails, payment reminders, unsubscribe email, account suspension, billing / receipt information




You should have answers for this questions:

- Ok, user are interested to work with BCC, and he want to try how "paying links" would work for his business - what's the next step?
- How he will understand what plan he need to pick?
- How he can pay?
- What will be next, when he send money?
- What information he must to provide, in order to list "paying links" on BBC website?
How much time will take to put all data to website? In what format he must to provide data to you?

What exactly is paying links and what he will get in exchange of money?
Page with product description and link to main business website? With image? Something else? Am i miss something?

Where he will be able to review only his products?

How you'll contact him, when all will be done(import to BBC website)?
Will he be able to make changes after import, in order that he don't like something?

How you'll make him understand that all is working fine?


--------
marketing plan

-------

In the beginning you'll have slow growth. You can see it right now. This will be because you don't have critical mass right now: users, products, countries, followers at social media, engaged followers(Important), revenue per month, articles in media, etc.

When you've got your critical mass - you'll got your fast growth and this will be a mark, when you find out that your startup is useful and you know WHAT your clients need. Before this moment you need to test different ideas. It's better to have few options, rather than on. This will give you opportunity to grow fast.


Sharing, posting - important stuff!
Sales, Single product promotions - that will bring attention.
10 posts in soc media per day using Buffer.
Use crowdfire/paper.li for posting and growing subscription base.

Each week make digest for authenticity shops or products with links to their websites.
5-10 posts to Instagram per day. Make growing goals. Ex: - get each month + 100.

Recreate pitch deck - add more beauty (make it modern looking, but keeping the same logic of information)
I share an archive in trello to you. Buzz me and I'll explain. This template will add shine to pitch deck.

I don't use it, but it's good. I can share samples with data - to give idea how it must looks
Submit to different startup networks:
- f6s update, add more information to profile
index.io update, add more information

https://gust.com + updated pitch deck add to this website

Think about video marketing. maybe you can cooperate with some artist and make barter and get video. or pay $50 and get simple professional video for youtube.

Create press release, prepare archive with marketing kit - logos in different colors, information about owner, main project description

Grow your network AngelList & Linkedin
Add each connection from AngelList to Linkedin with note "from AngelList" - reason.

ask your friends to link FB page of BBC, facebook have automatic functionality for this


---
Note: for managing contacts - you need to use CRM start with hubspot Sales - free and easy to manage.

------
You need to follow instructions on this website to get more PR: https://casual.pm/how-to/startup-press-coverage

------

Promotion for different type of clients.
Maybe you need to create a different Landing pages for different countries. With different form elements

Different type of clients will motivate different benefits from your project.

I don't like to name it "different landing pages". It's better to call - pages with different submission process. Focused on different type of countries, product categories.

For increasing revenue I think it'll be great to have a multilingual project, support different currencies. I think it must be included to specification.

You can have a different ways - create a dictionary for project labels and translate it - this is common way, but you'll need help of native speakers. Or you can pay to localisation service. It will help you to translate a lot of things on the fly.

It'll be good to have a lawyer with knowledge of foreign laws. So you'll be able to make a contacts, sign documents, etc.





Address book extension must categorize different countries and company addresses.
Extended version of database must have complex logic for categorization.


I propose to have 3 stages for categories:
* easy) just copy content from first BBC website.
* difficult) complex structure, that cover most types of products
* not easy)  leave only categories, that makes profit. other categories can be just trashed, or moved to "other/uncategorized" section


///////////////////////////////


Big topics to cover.


Payments


Auto Posting functionality for "paying-links"

Admin validation for companies and "paying links"

"Open BBC in new countries" - fast way

Big, fast, easy and accurate product import. Ex: Large company have 500 products on different categories with different content and different product attributes: outfit, shoes, accessories, perfumes. Like Louis Vuitton company.

Business directory of companies(I think you'll need it). It can be created using data that will submit business owners to you. This will also add some functionality to your project and can increase profits.




=========

Database parts:

###Address book
Countries
Towns
Business Addresses
Contact Data

###Users
###Categories
###Business types

###Orders
###Statistics
###Affiliates
###Google maps data

###Products/paying links
Product attributes like size, count, color, etc.
Paying links statistics
Options/ settings
Chat DB

###Languages, localization stuff

###Blog
Write at least 1-3 posts per week




Support===========
best choice - use intercom, but it's not cheap.
It's a good choice if you have more than 50 daily tickets. It give ability to create 'helpers' for different project pages - this helpers can motivate and help users to registrate, purchase pricing plans, add something to website, etc.
This tool can increase revenue.

2) Zendesk - good
3) HGroove - free version of zendesk. have less functionality.
