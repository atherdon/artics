Hi Betty,
this is my long letter with my thoughts.

This is also my new main email address.

About funding BBC.

In case if you wouldn't got funding after Web Summit - Maybe this is not what are you need right now?

I know a lot of different methods, how to do things in startups and most of them is not about getting money.
I hate to get more money that it need to be in business :) When you have a lot of unnecessary money - you just waste them not wisely. For most cases. It's a big art of manipulating money well.

Maybe it will be better to start talking with your future users, and setup a minimal, but working things for them.


Btw ask some help at women.win - this is website build by Renata George with purpose to support women owners.

I think "Minimal Functionality approach" will work.
Because right now looks like you have idea and you need funding, but you must invest time on building platform. Because when you'll find money - you still will need to spend time on platform, new users, etc. 


About Plan.

For example you look for $2mil of investments and you think in 5 years startup will be awesome.
I planned a lot of things related to business/clients/employees/money and I know this formula: multiply time 2x, multiply money 3x.
With this approach - you'll be able to make what you decided to do.

So I think money its not really important.
Because for what is important - you'll find resources.
As example - you fly to Web Summit because you need it. So you'll always find a way.



Think big, do small.

Let's start from small task: setup your country first, or your town first.

If I was your investor - you'll need to show me something more that idea, slides, your passion.
I'll challenge you: Betty, how much time you'll spend for filling excel file with 100 products from your town? Or how I'll understand that your idea is work not only in your mind?


Then I would ask you to show this 100 products on your website.

Not like now - from slides you'll have different countries, different categories, but blank website.


Next step. I would challenge you to increase products number to 1000.

And this is really difficult. First 100 products you can find just go to 10 shops. You can use same approach for 1000 products. like visit 100 or 150 shops. But this is not very clever. Without internet power this is stupid, but sometimes I like doing things in stupid way :)
So on this step you'll must invent a new working method.

When you'll add 1000 on your website by hand - you'll know a lot of information!
You also will understand what can be improved, or what can help you extend your project.



Other big side is social media.
It will be important to promote products on twitter, facebook. Make contests and offer discounts. And you'll need to do this frequently.


Next Step will be automatically import products, companies to website.
But developer will need to understand what fields he must import. This is why on first step you've build an excel file only.

When import will be done - you'll need to have another 1k products - so you'll test your import functionality on real data.

After completing this steps I think a lot of investors will understand that you can grow business and this is good idea to invest on BBC.


I have a lot of ideas for future startups, like you.
But I find a way, how to manage my mind and how to test ideas.

For each one i try to answer on few questions. If this idea pass all questions - it can worth to remember it.

Can I guarantee fast growth?
Can I create a simple first version in 7 days?
Can this idea warm me and my partner too?

Example:
Create a big website-database of shop coupons(discounts) and make money on it - this is complex thing.

But create 1 page, where will be displayed posts from twitter with hastag #dallas #discount - this can be done in 20 minutes.

What option is better? Second because you can launch it right now, setup automatic social media cross-posting and then you can forget about this website but it'll work.

Example.
Create website when user can easily create logo from huge database of templates - not easy.

But create website where user can pick one default icon and write company name using one of 10 google fonts - this can be done in 1 hour.

Of course this projects have restrictions. You cannot make money fast on it.
But they can work, you don't spend money/time on it - and you happy that this projects launched.
Later it will be easy to extend this projects. Made another version rather than build your website year and year.


In this time this approach are very helpful.
Because any one can spend a lot of money and build great product.
But only few can do this without bunch of money.


If I'll show this text to experienced developer - he'll tell me that I'm crazy and this is not working. And wouldn't start company.

Experienced entrepreneur - this is not make a lot money - will not try.

But for child 14 years old, for student - they can make some bucks with that website without big skills.


later if project will went to success story - you'll monetize it.

I have some examples of companies with and without money. Both have same rate of success :)


Monetization is just another big topic.

When you have a small company - you must have a big margins.
And if you have some bad things happened - money pillow will help you to survive.
A lot of people tell that big margin is bad. But this a business rules. Money is like blood.
Most important is money on account. So in any cases - you can convert it to cash.

Formula is: margin must be 400%. for small companies.

For first users or products, all things must be free.
You can focus on one segment, or on different.
On luxury market or on cheap market.
With luxury you'll have big price tag. With cheap you can sell more products, because cheap people buy more frequently. 

On some segment user  can buy 12 bottles of wine, on another segment user can buy only one.
So they must have a different strategy.

So you need to disable not important and focus on fast things/steps. Example from "Rework" book. If you want to build a hot-dog tent - what is most important? Big tent? Good advertising? Ketchup? Without this things you can run this business. But without hot-dogs - you cannot. So I think users with products is The Thing.

For example do only one task in one week.
So in one month you'll do 4 task, but did it well.

I talk with different startup owners. I also talk with a lot of clients on freelance websites.
Most of them want to build complex things with small amount of money/resources. This is a bad approach. Because facebook was not build in 3 month.
fb is also unique example.
--------------------------------


If I was you and was building product list that I asked you before.

I'll start with simple but fast way to do this.

1 option - go to different shops in your town, talk with owners, move their products to database. 
2 option - i'll find something unique. Like hand-made things. Something that made only on your country.

2.1 find 10 product categories and 1000 products add to website

2.2 other way fill only one category with 1000 products.

2.3 get only one product and try to make a lot of sales of them.

Example: wine.
Write an article for wine pre-order. If you'll have 100 requests - we'll sell it with discount.
Or buy 10 bottles in one order - and shipping is free.
Then you go to shop owner and require discount from him.
With this approach you'll do a full cycle. From product - to selling via your website.



1. I'll choose town, not country. Because it's easy to move between shops.
And create a document with 1 row is one wine shop website address.

And find 100 shops.
Then add 10 custom products for each shop.
All this products i'll grab from website. 
So I'll have 1000 products with information from web.

Other way is find small company, without online presence and focus to gain sales and profit to company owner.
And discuss details about future discounts, good offers to you.
But this option cannot make money for you in fast way.


Story.
I have few clients from Dallas. I dreamed that my clients promote me locally and I was able to go to Dallas market of small companies. But they say no. So I'll find another ways :)

I have idea to create website-directory with all restaurants in Dallas and promote them. I created a document with completed information about this cafes, but this thing not go further. I got about 800 places and for most of this cafes they have not great websites. But this was not a right time for starting.

Maybe later I'll use this data, but not sure how. Because right now I don't want to talk with each restaurant owners - I'll try to find a way how to contact them in bulk. 

Maybe I'll create a unique design template for restaurant menus, import data and offer to download this template for $1 - $10.
This is not a big money, but this is not a complex project to build.

In first time I'll put this information by my hands.
Later it can be possible to hire an employee for data import or find service for exporting data.

And later extend monetization model with adding different templates, different prices, etc.
----------------------------------------------




Main idea for small startups - they don't asking additional money in first time.

Other way is sell exclusive products on your website, so you'll need to sign a contract - and you'll run a product promotion company. 
Other way, that save a lot of time and energy - start from selling digital goods, not a wine, shoes, books. Because you'll need to ship it, pay additional taxes, etc. Sell digital things is easier - you only need to store them and protect. 

Thanks,
