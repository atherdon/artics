What I start to understand after chatting with a few startups(food tech).

They all have only local teams.

They still not sure how monetize(if be closed most time is not a marketing)

they think they are unique, but guys, it's a food, it all about making food,
-> it's about whole mankind history about eating

-> They will non survive more than 2 years
They have "vision", not a straight plan.

For sure I'm wrong, but a lot of Food Startup owners that I
have pleasure to talk -> they must be were free from judgement too.

Of course they trying to invent something & make live better,
but it's still no innovation: (my experience limited. Just my analysis.)


They want 100% completed project and only then launch. Don't like an MVP approach.

This is their first(second) project(startup/business) only.


Numbers. писал я в 120-180 стартапов всего.
примерная конверсия была ( из 80 отправленных писем(краткое сообщение, ничего growndbreaking) vyt jndtnbkj dctuj 12 и из них 8 довели наше обсуждение проектов до чего то серьезного)

так что я думаю что серьезно я необходимо с min 18 проектов, максимум 25-30 проектов.
