What I start to understand after chatting with a few startups(food tech mostly(80%)).

They all have only local teams.

They still not sure how to monetize(if be closed most time is not a marketing)

they think they are unique, but guys, it's a food, it all about making food,
-> it's about whole mankind history about eating

-> They will not survive more than 2 years
They have "vision", not a straight plan. Can fail with finances and give up.

For sure I'm wrong, but a lot of Food Startup owners that I
have a pleasure to talk -> they raise this.

Of course, they trying to invent something & make life better,
but it's still no innovation: (again - my experience is limited. Just my analysis.) Hope to see more innovative companies related to Food Industry.


They want 100% completed project and only then launch. Don't like an MVP approach.

This is their first(second) project(startup/business) only.


Numbers. I send a message to 120-180 in common.
Conversion example: I send 80 short letters - I got 12 replies and with 8 owners we have long chats. So I assume I reviewed deeply 18(25-30max) projects only.
