Important parts for growing marketplace startup(late stages)

 - Affiliate management

- Link generation and clicks counts. We need to create a rule for good SEO of paying links. Add statistics and count how many users click to links and go to business website and buy it or not something, sign up or not. Like reverse affiliate management.



 - relative products. I think you can find a few big affiliate networks and use it for some money and growth. Like Etsy, Amazon. Better way to use data scraping, but manage categories and countries by hands.

- Categorization. DB schema, analytics, types. A lot of things to discuss.

- Address book. A lot of databases or frameworks have it like extension.

- Working with SEO, meta tags, titles, shares, etc.

 - Each page / Paying links must have extended version of meta attributes, schema.ogr attributes

- It will be foreseeing move to create an API at backend/architecture development stage.
- Another feature can be chatbot development. it can be integrated on different messengers and will help users to browse products on BBC from Fb Messenger app
- Search functionality must use search engine with indexes, caching, etc. it will be important, when you'll store big amount of data

- Products Delivery. Did you plan to organize product delivery? I think you need delivery, if you'll be well funded. In other case you can risk your reputation if business owner(paying links buyer) fail something. With product delivery you'll need to include shipping calculations.

- support/faq/help sections

- Money-Back situations. So, if user buy something, but later want to return money - you'll be able send back his money account.
